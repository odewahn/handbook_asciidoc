== Going Green



image::images/pdf5131_img_17.png[]

&ldquo;Going Green&rdquo; means practicing an environmentally friendly and ecologically responsible lifestyle as well as making decisions to help protect the environment and sustain natural resources. There are lots of reasons to consider going green—too much trash, greenhouse gases, air and water pollution, damage to the ozone layer, and saving money. For example, switching all of the light bulbs in a home from conventional incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs could save about $40 over the life of the bulb. Other examples include: 


*  Turn your thermostat down two degrees in winter and up two degrees in summer. 


*  Make sure your walls and ceilings are well insulated. 


*  Replace bathroom and kitchen faucets with low-flow models.

.Beware: Verify Green Marketing Claims
****
The number of products claiming they are &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; or &ldquo;all-natural&rdquo; has increased due to a growing demand for &ldquo;green&rdquo; products. You may be unsure about which environmental standards and labels can be trusted. You can use the FTC&rsquo;s Green Guides (link:$$http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427$$[])  as a resource to verify that the environmental attributes or products are truthful. Here are some tips to help you sort through eco-label marketing: 


*  Look for specific (for example, &ldquo;contains 75% postconsumer recycled materials&rdquo;) rather than vague statements about environmental impact. 


*  Determine whether the green marketing claims apply to the packaging, the product, or both.             


*  Beware of fake third-party certification. Visit Consumer Reports&rsquo; website (link:$$http://www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels$$[www.greenerchoices.org/eco-labels]) to find reliable environmental labels.

=== Buying Green

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) link:$$http://www.epa.gov/greenerproducts$$[has a green products web portal (www.epa.gov/]greenerproducts) to help you navigate the complex world of green products. The EPA also has a number of eco-labeling partnership programs to help you identify greener, safer, and more efficient products. Look for these EPA program labels when buying: 


*  __ENERGY STAR__—For energy-efficient electronics and link:$$http://www.energystar.gov$$[appliances (www.energystar.gov]) 


.Watersense Makes Sense

U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Agricultural Marketing Service at link:$$http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0$$[www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0]. There are no national standards for organic clothing, but some fabrics to consider include organic cotton, bark cloth, bamboo, and organic wool. 

By making greener product choices, you are saving money on utilities and fuel, and protecting public health and the environment. 


=== Reusing and Recycling

You can make a big impact by using the products you buy in ways that respect the environment: 


*  Use fewer products and follow instructions for product use. 


*  Conserve energy, water, and materials. 


*  Recycle items made of materials such as glass, metal, plastic, or paper. 


*  Dispose of products properly. 

Many utility companies now offer curbside recycling programs that provide U.S. households with a responsible and convenient way to recycle materials. To locate information on recycling services and efforts in  your area, visit Earth 911&rsquo;s website (link:$$http://www.earth911.org$$[]) or call its toll-free hotline, 1-800-CLEANUP (253-2687). 

It is easy to dispose of many products safely. Others, such  as car batteries, cell phones, televisions, paints, oils, and solvents, require special handling. You can dispose of these products responsibly through your local household hazardous waste (HHW) collection facility or at your local government&rsquo;s annual HHW collection day. Some items may be given to charitable organizations or even dropped off at electronics retailers. Contact the EPA (p. 105) to help you make the right decisions about the best way to dispose of waste.
