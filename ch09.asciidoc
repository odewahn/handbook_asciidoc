== Health Care



image::images/pdf5131_img_19.png[]

There are plenty of resources available to help you make health care decisions. Be wary of websites sponsored by companies that are trying to sell you a particular treatment. It&rsquo;s better to contact reputable associations or visit sites run by government agencies and recognized organizations such as the Mayo Clinic or the American Medical Association (AMA). This information should complement, not replace, what you receive from a doctor. Here are some sites that are generally recognized as reliable information sources: 


*  HealthFinder.gov and MedlinePlus (link:$$http://www.medlineplus.gov$$[]) provide information on health issues, health care programs, and organizations. 


*  Mayo Clinic (link:$$http://www.mayoclinic.com$$[]) offers an index of diseases and much more. 


*  Medical Library Association (link:$$http://www.mlanet.org$$[]) links to websites suggested by librarians. 


*  National Institute of Mental Health (link:$$http://www.nimh.nih.gov$$[]) provides information on research about understanding and treating mental illness. 


*  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (link:$$http://www.samhsa.gov$$[]) provides information on prevention, treatment, and recovery from substance abuse or mental health issues. 


*  HealthCare.gov (link:$$http://www.healthcare.gov/compare$$[]) provides tools that help compare doctors, hospitals, and nursing homes. 


=== Choosing A Doctor

When searching for a primary care doctor, dentist, specialist, or other health care professional: 


*  Find out whether the health care professional is licensed in your state. A state or local occupational and professional licensing board will be able to give you this information. 


*  Research whether the health care professional is board-certified in the appropriate specialty. Visit  link:$$http:ama-assn.org$$[www.ama-assn.org] and link:$$http://www.abms.org$$[www.abms.org] for more information. 


*  Ask how often the health care professional has done the procedure you need or has treated your condition. You may be able to find some of this information on the Internet. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports the success rates and number of procedures performed by fertility clinics at link:$$http://www.cdc.gov$$[www.cdc.gov]. Some states also collect and post data on the success of heart-bypass surgery. 


*  Check whether there have been any complaints or disciplinary actions taken against the provider you are researching. Visit link:$$http://www.docboard.org$$[www.docboard.org] for more information. There are also pay-for-use sites with similar information, including link:$$http://www.Docinfo.org$$[www.docinfo.org] and link:$$http://www.mdnationwide.org$$[www.mdnationwide.org]. Visit link:$$http://www.healthfinder.gov$$[www.healthfinder.gov] and link:$$http://www.ahrq.gov/consumer$$[www.ahrq.gov/consumer] for more advice on identifying providers. 


*  Find out what doctors participate in your health insurance plan. If you are having surgery, check that all providers (radiologists, anesthesiologists) are also covered by your plan, to avoid surprise bills. 

Consider these questions regarding your health care provider and his or her practice: 


*  Does the doctor participate in your insurance plan? 


*  Is the office in an area that you can get to easily or does it have hours during times when you can make an appointment? 


*  Does the doctor have privileges at the hospital you prefer? 


*  Do you get along well with the doctor? Do you feel that you communicate well with each other and that he or she listens to your concerns and explains diagnoses and benefits of new treatments and prescriptions clearly? 


*  What is the doctor&rsquo;s cancelation policy? 


*  Will you have to pay for the visit if you cancel your appointment? 


==== Filing a Complaint

If you have a complaint about the medical services you received from a physician, you may file a complaint with your state medical board. For a complete directory from the Federation of State Medical Boards, visit link:$$http://www.fsmb.org/directory_smb.html$$[]. You can also call the Federation at 817-868-4000 to get the phone number of your state&rsquo;s medical board. 


=== Choosing A Health Care Facility

Report cards on the Internet can help you compare health care facilities. Compare doctors and health care facilities at link:$$http://www.healthcare.gov/compare$$[www.healthcare.gov/compare]. In addition, link:$$http://www.usnews.com$$[www.usnews.com] and link:$$http://www.healthgrades.com$$[www.healthgrades.com] rate hospitals based on information collected from Medicare records and other sources. As of October 2012, the Affordable Care Act requires all hospitals to report performance publically. 


.Medical Identity Theft
****
Medical identity theft can occur when someone steals  your personal information number to obtain medical  care, buy medication, or submit fake claims to your  insurer or Medicare in your name. To prevent medical  identity theft, you can:


*  Guard your Social Security, Medicare, and health  insurance identification numbers. Only give your  number to your physician or other approved health  care providers. 


*  Review your explanation of benefits or Medicare  Summary Notice to make sure that the claims match  the services you received. Report questionable  charges to your health insurance provider or Medicare. 


*  Request and carefully review a copy of your medical  records for inaccuracies and conditions that you don&rsquo;t  have. 

If you believe you have been a victim of medical identity  theft, file a complaint with the FTC at 1-877- 438-4338 or  link:$$http://ftccomplaintassistant.gov$$[http://ftccomplaintassistant.gov] and your health insurance  company&rsquo;s fraud department. If you suspect that you  have been the victim of Medicare fraud, contact the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo;  Inspector General at 1-800-447-8477 or by e-mail at  pass:[<email>HHSTips@oig.hhs.gov</email>].

=== Prescription Drugs



image::images/pdf5131_img_20.png[]

Your pharmacist oversees an important part of your  health care by providing the medications prescribed  by other health care professionals. It&rsquo;s important that  you are proactive and communicate honestly with  your pharmacist. Topics you should discuss with your  pharmacist include: 


*  What other medications you take 


*  Whether you have allergic reactions to any medications 


*  Whether there is a generic version of the medication  you can take instead 


*  Any questions about the medication you are receiving 


*  Whether there is a risk that your medications don&rsquo;t mix  well with each other 


*  Whether there any side effects to the medications 


.Where To Go For Medical Care
****
When you are sick, you may not know the best place to go for medical care. In non-emergency situations, your first choice should be your primary care provider (PCP). Your PCP knows your medical history and treats common ailments. Urgent care is best when you need medical attention for a non-life threatening illness quickly or after regular hours. Go to the emergency room if your illness is serious or life-threatening, such as: 


*  Choking 


*  Stopped breathing 


*  Head injury with passing out, fainting, or confusion 


*  Injury to neck or spine, especially if there is loss of feeling or inability to move 


*  Electric shock or lightning strike 


*  Severe burn 


*  Seizure that lasts three to five minutes

Remember to finish your entire prescription, since some illnesses require treatment to continue past the time when symptoms go away. Make certain that your pharmacy has your current health and prescription insurance on record so you get the best price possible. If you have difficulty paying for your medications, contact the manufacturer; some pharmaceutical companies have patient assistance programs to help you afford your medication. 

An increasing number of consumers are replacing a trip to the pharmacy with a visit to the Internet. While there are online pharmacies that provide legitimate prescription services, there are also some questionable sites that make buying medicines online risky. Do business only with a licensed U.S. pharmacy. Check with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy to determine whether the site is licensed and in good standing. Visit link:$$http://www.nabp.net$$[www.nabp.net] or call 847-391-4406. 

If you suspect a site is not a licensed pharmacy, report it and any complaints to the Food and Drug Administration (p. 100) at link:$$http://www.fda.gov/Safety/ReportaProblem/ucm059315.htm$$[www.fda.gov/Safety/ReportaProblem/ucm059315.htm]. 

Want to know the side effects of a particular medication? Curious whether a drug has been approved by the FDA?  For answers to these questions and other information on approved  prescription and over-the-counter and discontinued drugs, visit link:$$http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/$$[www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda].  For general drug information, you can also contact the FDA (p. 100). 


=== Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage

Medicare offers prescription drug coverage to help senior citizens and others who need medical assistance get the prescription drugs they need, under Part D of the program (or Part C if you are enrolled in the Medicare Advantage Plan). Everyone with Medicare can join a drug plan to get this coverage. Not all Medicare drug plans are the same, however. If you aren&rsquo;t sure whether a drug plan is approved by Medicare, call 1-800-MEDICARE (6334227). Look for the &ldquo;Medicare Approved&rdquo; seal on drug discount cards to make sure you are getting the best deal. 

Medicare prescription drug coverage pays expenses up to $2,800; once your prescription costs exceeds that amount, you will no longer have coverage and will be responsible for the full cost of your drugs. However, once your out-of-pocket spending reaches $4,550, your prescription coverage will kick back in. Any amount of prescription drug spending between $2,800 and $4,550 is called the coverage gap or &ldquo;Medicare donut hole.&rdquo; Beginning in 2013, if you reach the coverage gap, you will automatically get a 52.5% discount on covered brand-name drugs and a 14% discount on generic drugs. If you have limited income and resources, you may get extra help to cover prescription drugs for little or no cost. For more information, contact the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (p. 100).

=== Advance Medical Directives

We all face the possibility that we may become incapacitated sometime during our lifetime. This often happens when nearing death, but it can also be the result of a temporary condition. Many people assume their spouses or children will automatically be allowed to make financial and/or medical decisions for them, but this is not necessarily true. 

Advance directives are written documents that tell your doctors what kind of treatment you want if you become unable to make medical decisions (for example, if you&rsquo;re in a coma). Forms and laws vary from state to state, so it&rsquo;s a good idea to understand the laws of the state where you live when you write advance directives. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to make them before you are very ill. Federal law requires hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions that receive Medicare or Medicaid funds to provide written information regarding advance medical directives to all patients upon admission. 

A living will is one type of advance directive that goes into effect when a person is terminally ill. A living will does not give you the opportunity to select someone to make decisions for you, but it does allow you to specify the kind of treatment you want in specific situations. For example, you might choose to specify that you do not want to be treated with antibiotics if death is imminent. You can, if you choose, include an advance directive that you do not wish to be resuscitated if your heart stops or if you stop breathing. In this case, a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order would be entered on your medical chart. 


==== Naming a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care

A durable power of attorney for health care (sometimes called a durable medical power of attorney) specifies the person you&rsquo;ve chosen to make medical decisions for you. It is activated when you&rsquo;re unconscious or unable to make medical decisions, or when you have specified. You need to choose someone who meets the legal requirements in your state for acting as your agent. State laws vary, but most states disqualify anyone under the age of 18, your health care provider, or employees of your health care provider. 

The person you choose as your agent must: 


*  Be willing to speak and advocate on your behalf 


*  Be willing to deal with conflict among friends and family members, if it arises 


*  Know you well and understand your wishes 


*  Be willing to talk with you about these issues 


*  Be someone you trust with your life
