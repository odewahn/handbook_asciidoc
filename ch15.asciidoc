=== Telemarketing and Unwanted Mail



image::images/pdf5131_img_31.png[]

What can you do about the growing pile of unwanted mail in your mailbox and unwelcome telemarketers on your phone? Actually, there&rsquo;s a lot you can do: 


*  Tell companies you do business with to remove your name from customer lists they rent or sell to others. Look for information on how to opt out of marketing lists on sales materials, order forms, and websites. 


*  Use the services provided by the Direct Marketing Association (p. 144) to remove your name from most national telemarketing, mail, and e-mail lists. 


*  Call the credit reporting agencies&rsquo; notification system at 1-888-567-8688. This will reduce the number of unsolicited credit and insurance offers you get. All three major credit bureaus participate in this program. 


*  Under U.S. Postal Service (USPS) rules, it is illegal to send mail that looks like it is from a government agency when it isn&rsquo;t. It is also illegal to send mail that looks like a bill when nothing was ordered, unless it clearly states that it is not a bill. Report violations of this rule to the USPS (p. 108). 


=== National Do Not Call Registry

The federal government&rsquo;s Do Not Call Registry allows you to restrict telemarketing calls permanently by registering your phone number at link:$$http://www.donotcall.gov$$[www.donotcall.gov] or by calling 1-888-382-1222. If you receive telemarketing calls after your number has been in the national registry for three months, you can file a complaint using the same web page and toll-free number. 

Placing your number on this national registry will stop most telemarketing calls, but not all of them. Calls that are still permitted include those from political organizations, charities, telephone surveyors, and some organizations with which you have a relationship. 

In addition, the standard has always been that telemarketers are not allowed to call cell phones. Cell phone numbers can also be added to the Do Not Call Registry (link:$$https://www.donotcall.gov/$$[]),  but it is not necessary, since telemarketers are already forbidden to call them. 


=== Pre-recorded Messages

Pre-recorded sales calls or robocalls are illegal. Companies cannot transmit these messages to consumers who have not agreed, in writing, to accept such messages. Pre-recorded calls may only be made to residential telephone numbers in the following cases: 


*  Emergency calls needed to ensure your health and safety 


*  Non-commercial calls 


*  Calls that don&rsquo;t include any unsolicited advertisements 


*  Calls by, or on behalf of, tax-exempt nonprofit organizations 


*  Calls for which you have given prior consent 


*  Calls from entities with which you have an established 

business relationship If you receive pre-recorded telemarketing calls but have not agreed to get them, file a complaint with the FTC at link:$$http://www.donotcall.gov$$[www.donotcall.gov] or by calling 1-888-382-1222. 


=== Telemarketing Sales Calls

An FTC rule defines what telemarketers can and cannot do when making a sales call. Callers must: 


*  Provide the seller&rsquo;s name 


*  Disclose that the call is a sales call 


*  Tell you exactly what they&rsquo;re trying to sell 


*  Disclose the total cost and other terms of sale before you make any payment for goods or services 


*  Tell you if they don&rsquo;t allow refunds, exchanges, or cancellations 


.Opting Out
****
Tired of unwanted e-mail filling up your inbox? You can opt out of most unsolicited e-mail lists by going to the &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; button, usually found at the bottom of the message. Some senders make the button difficult to find, so you may have to do some searching. 

In addition, the Direct Marketing Association lets you opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial mail from many national companies for three years. You can register with this service for a small fee, but your registration only applies to organizations that use the association&rsquo;s Mail Preference Service. To register, go to link:$$http://www.dmachoice.org$$[www.dmachoice.org]. If you would like to opt out of credit and insurance offers, you can call 1-888-567-8688 or go online at link:$$http://www.optoutprescreen.com$$[www.optoutprescreen.com], which is managed by the major credit reporting companies.

If a prize is involved, the caller must give you the odds of winning, inform you that no purchase is necessary, and tell you how to get instructions for entering without buying anything. It&rsquo;s illegal for telemarketers to: 


*  Misrepresent what they&rsquo;re offering 


*  Call before 8 am or after 9 pm 


*  Threaten, intimidate, or harass you, or call again if you  ask them not to 

This FTC rule applies even when you receive a call from a telemarketer in another state or country. It also applies when you make a call to a company in another state or country in response to a mail solicitation. 

The rule generally does not apply when you call to order from a catalog or in response to an ad on television or radio, or in a magazine or newspaper. It also does not apply to solicitations you receive by fax or e-mail. Beware that certain types of businesses, including nonprofit organizations, investment brokers and advisors, and banks and financial institutions, are exempt from the rule. 

If you get a phone call from someone who says he or she is with your bank and/or credit company and the person asks you to provide or confirm any personal information: 


*  Do NOT answer any questions. 


*  Hang up immediately. 


*  Call your bank or credit company directly and describe what happened.
