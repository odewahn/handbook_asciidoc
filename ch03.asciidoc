Whether you are buying or leasing a vehicle, these tips will help you get the best deal and avoid problems: 


*  Decide what kind of vehicle best suits your needs and budget. 


*  Check out the seller. For car dealers, check with your state or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and Better Business Bureau (p. 67). If you&rsquo;re buying from an individual, check the title to make sure you&rsquo;re dealing with the vehicle&rsquo;s owner. 


*  Take a test drive. Drive at different speeds and check for smooth right and left turns. On a straight stretch, make sure the vehicle doesn&rsquo;t pull to one side. 


*  Handle trade-ins and financing separately from your purchase to get the best deal on each. Get a written price quote before you talk about a trade-in or dealer financing. 


*  Shop in advance and compare financing options at your credit union, bank, or finance company. Look at the total finance charges and the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), not just the monthly payment. 


*  Read and understand every document you are asked to sign. 


*  Don&rsquo;t take possession of the car until all paperwork is final. 


*  Choose an auto insurance policy that is right for you (p. 32).

=== Buying a New Car

Do your research first and compare vehicles. Four key resources that offer vehicle performance, service, and safety information are: _Consumer Reports_ (link:$$http://www.consumerreports.org$$[]), __Motor Trend__ (link:$$http://www.motortrend.com$$[]), __Car and Driver__ (link:$$http://www.caranddriver.com$$[]), and Edmunds automotive books and network (link:$$http://www.edmunds.com$$[]). 


*  Research the dealer&rsquo;s price for the car and options. It&rsquo;s easier to get the best price when you know what the dealer paid for a vehicle. The dealer invoice price is available on a number of websites and in printed pricing guides. _Consumer Reports_ offers the wholesale price; this figure factors in dealer incentives from a manufacturer and is a more accurate estimate of what a dealer is paying for a vehicle. 


*  Find out whether the manufacturer is offering rebates that will lower the cost. For more information, visit link:$$http://www.autopedia.com/html/Rebate.html$$[www.autopedia.com/html/Rebate.html]. 


*  Get price quotes from several dealers. Find out if the amounts quoted are the prices before or after rebates are deducted. 


*  Avoid low-value extras such as credit insurance, extended warranties, auto club memberships, rustproofing, and upholstery finishes. You do not have to purchase credit insurance to get a loan. See Service Contracts and Extended Warranties (p. 2). 


*  Hybrid cars are popular among consumers interested in fuel economy and reducing their negative impact on the environment. These cars combine the benefits of gasoline engines and electric motors and can be configured to achieve different objectives, such as improved fuel economy, increased power, or additional auxiliary power. For more information about hybrids, electric vehicles, and alternative fuels, visit link:$$http://www.fueleconomy.gov$$[www.fueleconomy.gov].

[[buying_a_used_car]]

=== Buying A Used Car


*  To learn what rights you have when buying a used car, contact your state or local consumer protection office (p. 112). 


*  Find out in advance what paperwork you will need to register a vehicle. Contact your state&rsquo;s motor vehicle department. See link:$$http://www.usa.gov/Topics/Motor_Vehicles.shtml$$[www.usa.gov/Topics/Motor_Vehicles.shtml]. 


*  Check prices of similar models using the _NADA Official Used Car Guide_ (link:$$http://www.nadaguides.com$$[]) published by the National Automobile Dealers Association or the __Kelley Blue Book__ (link:$$http://www.kbb.com$$[]). These guides are usually available at local libraries. 


*  Research the vehicle&rsquo;s history. Ask the seller for details concerning past owners, use, and maintenance. Next, find out whether the car has been damaged in a flood, involved in a crash, been labeled a &ldquo;lemon,&rdquo; or had its odometer rolled back. 


*  Your state motor vehicle department can research the car&rsquo;s title history. 


*  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&rsquo;s (NHTSA) website (link:$$http://www.safercar.gov$$[]) lets you search an online database of manufacturer service bulletins and review crash test ratings. 


*  The website link:$$http://www.vehiclehistory.gov$$[www.vehiclehistory.gov] and the National Insurance Crime Bureau&rsquo;s free database (link:$$http://www.nicb.org$$[]) are centralized places for consumers to buy information on the history of vehicles gathered from state motor vehicle departments and other sources. These reports are helpful but do not guarantee that a vehicle is accident-free. 


*  The Center for Auto Safety (link:$$http://www.autosafety.org$$[]) provides information on safety defect recalls, complaints and service bulletins. 


*  Make sure any mileage disclosures match the odometer reading on the car. 


*  Check the warranty. If a manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty is still in effect, contact the manufacturer to make sure you can use the coverage. 


*  Ask about the dealer&rsquo;s return policy. Get it in writing and read it carefully. 


*  Have your mechanic inspect the car. Talk to the seller and agree in advance that you&rsquo;ll pay for the examination if the car passes inspection, but the seller will pay if significant problems are discovered. A qualified mechanic should check the vehicle&rsquo;s frame, tires, air bags, and undercarriage as well as the engine. 


*  Examine dealer documents carefully. Make sure you are buying—not leasing—the vehicle. Leases use terms such as &ldquo;balloon payment&rdquo; and &ldquo;base mileage&rdquo; disclosures. 

[[dealer_versus_private-party_purchases]]

=== Dealer Versus Private-party Purchases

In general, buying a used car from a dealer is a safer option because you are dealing with an institution, which means you are better protected by law. The FTC requires dealers to post a Buyer&rsquo;s Guide in the window of each used car or truck on their lot. This guide specifies whether the vehicle is being sold &ldquo;as is&rdquo; (in the vehicle&rsquo;s current condition, without a warranty) or with a warranty, and what percentage of repair costs a dealer will pay under the warranty. Keep in mind that private sellers generally have less responsibility than dealers do for defects or other problems. FTC rules do not apply to private-party sales. 

Expect to pay higher prices at a dealer than if you buy from an individual. Many dealers inspect their cars and provide an inspection report with each one. However, this is no substitute for your own inspection. Some dealers provide limited warranties, and most sell extended warranties. Watch out for dealer warranties that are &ldquo;power train&rdquo; warranties only, and not &ldquo;bumper-tobumper,&rdquo; full-coverage warranties. It&rsquo;s best to compare warranties that are available from other sources. 

Some dealers sell &ldquo;certified&rdquo; cars. This generally means that the cars have had a more thorough inspection and come with a limited warranty. Prices for certified cars are generally higher. Be sure to get a list of what was inspected and what is covered under the warranty. 

Purchasing a car from a private seller may save you money, but there are risks. The car could be stolen, damaged, or still under a finance agreement. If a private seller lies to you about the  condition of the vehicle, you may sue the individual if you have  evidence and you can find him or her. An individual is very unlikely  to provide a written warranty. 


.Choose A Safe Vehicle
****
Crash tests can help you determine how well a vehicle will protect you in a crash. These organizations perform crash tests and rate vehicles: 


*  _The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration._ Each year, NHTSA (link:$$http://www.nhtsa.gov$$[]) crashes vehicles head-on into a wall and bashes them broadside to test their ability to protect their occupants. NHTSA focuses on evaluating vehicle restraints such as air bags and safety belts. 


*  _The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety._ A different test by the IIHS (link:$$http://www.hwysafety.org$$[]) uses offset-frontal car crashes to assess the protection a vehicle&rsquo;s structure provides. 


*  _Consumer Reports._ The annual auto issue of Consumer Reports (link:$$http://www.consumerreports.org$$[]) rates vehicles in terms of overall safety. Its safety score combines crash test results with a vehicle&rsquo;s accident-avoidance factors— emergency handling, braking, acceleration, and even driver comfort. 


*  _The National Motor Vehicle Title Information System._  The NMVTIS (link:$$http://www.vehiclehistory.gov$$[])  provides information about a vehicle&rsquo;s history and condition,  history, and, in some cases, theft. 

To find out whether a manufacturer has recalled a car for safety defects, contact NHTSA (p. 104). If a vehicle has been recalled, ask the dealer for proof that the defect has been repaired. Used vehicles should also have a current safety inspection sticker if your state requires one.

[[financing]]

=== Financing

Most car buyers today need some form of financing to purchase a new vehicle. Many use direct lending, that is, a loan from a finance company, bank, or credit union. In direct lending, a buyer agrees to pay the amount financed, plus an agreed-upon finance charge, over a specified period. Once a buyer and a vehicle dealership enter into a contract to purchase a vehicle, the buyer uses the loan proceeds from the direct lender to pay the dealership for the vehicle. 


.Long-term Car Loans
****
Some car dealers and banks offer loans that allow you to finance your car for longer periods than a traditional auto loan (more than six years). Before you decide on the length of your auto loan, weigh the pros and cons. Long-term loans can make your monthly payments smaller and allow you to refinance the loan after a few years, to reduce the length of the loan. Remember, however, that these loans can cost more over the life of the loan because you are paying interest for a longer period. Also, as the car depreciates, you may end up owing more on your loan than the value of the car. This is called negative equity. 

For more information about auto loans, visit link:$$http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/autos/aut04.shtm$$[www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/autos/aut04.shtm]. For information about negative equity, visit link:$$http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt083.shtm$$[www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt083.shtm]. 


****


Another common form is dealership financing, which offers convenience, financing options, and sometimes special, manufacturer-sponsored, low-rate deals. Before you make a financing decision, it&rsquo;s important to do your research: 


*  Decide in advance how much you can afford to spend and stick to your limit. 


*  Get a copy of your credit report and correct any errors before applying for a loan. 


*  Check buying guides to identify price ranges and best available deals. 

More information about vehicle financing, deciding what you can afford, and consumer protections is available at link:$$http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/autos/finance.shtm$$[www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/autos/finance.shtm]. If you need to file a complaint about your auto loan, visit link:$$http://www.consumerfinance.gov$$[www.consumerfinance.gov]. 

[[leasing]]

=== Leasing

When you lease, you pay to drive someone else&rsquo;s vehicle. Monthly payments for a lease may be lower than loan payments, but at the end of the lease, you do not own or have any equity in the car. To get the best deal, follow this advice in addition to the general suggestions for buying a car (p. 8): 


*  To help you compare leasing versus owning, the Consumer Leasing Act requires leasing companies to give you information on monthly payments and other charges. Check out link:$$http://www.leaseguide.com$$[www.leaseguide.com] and link:$$http://www.leasecompare.com$$[www.leasecompare.com] for more information. 


*  Consider using an independent agent rather than the dealer; you might find a better deal. Most financial institutions that offer auto financing also offer leasing options. 


*  Ask for details on wear and tear standards. Dings that you regard as normal wear and tear could be billed as significant damage at the end of your lease. 


*  Find out how many miles you can drive in a year. Most leases allow 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year. Expect a charge of 10 to 25 cents for each additional mile. 


*  Check the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty; it should cover the entire lease term and the number of miles you are likely to drive. 


*  Ask the dealer what happens if you give up the car before the end of your lease. There may be extra fees for doing so. 


*  Ask what happens if the car is involved in an accident. 


*  Get all of the terms in writing. Everything included with the car should be listed on the lease to avoid your being charged for &ldquo;missing&rdquo; equipment later. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers a consumer guide to auto leasing at link:$$http://www.consumerfinance.gov$$[www.consumerfinance.gov]. 

[[recalls]]

===  Recalls, &ldquo;Lemon&rdquo; Laws, And Secret Warranties

Sometimes a manufacturer makes a design or production mistake on a motor vehicle. A service bulletin notifies the dealer of the problem and how to resolve it. Because these free repairs are not publicized, they are called &ldquo;secret warranties.&rdquo; The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration maintains a database of service bulletins filed by manufacturers. 

If you have a problem with a vehicle that is a safety hazard, check whether the manufacturer has recalled your vehicle. You can find information about service bulletins, recalls, and other safety defects at www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ reclink:$$http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/recalls/recallsearch.cfm$$[alls/recallsearch.cfm or call DOT&rsquo;s Vehicle Safety]Hotline at 1-800-424-9393. You should report hazards that aren&rsquo;t listed to your dealer, the manufacturer of the vehicle (p. 64), and NHTSA at link:$$http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq$$[www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/ivoq]. If a safety-related defect exists, the maker must fix it at no cost to you—even if your warranty has expired. 

If you have a vehicle with a unique problem that just never seems to get fixed, you may have a &ldquo;lemon.&rdquo; Some states have laws concerning &ldquo;lemons&rdquo; that require a refund or replacement if a problem is not fixed within a reasonable number of tries. These laws might also go into effect if you haven&rsquo;t been able to use your vehicle for a certain number of days. Contact your state or local consumer protection office (p. 112) to learn whether you have such protections and what steps you must take to get your problem solved. If you believe your car is a &ldquo;lemon&rdquo;: 


*  Give the dealer a list of the problems every time you bring it in for repairs. 


*  Get and keep copies of the repair orders listing the problems, the work done, and the dates the car was in the shop. 


*  Contact the manufacturer, as well as the dealer, to report the problem. Check your owner&rsquo;s manual or the directory for the auto manufacturer (p. 64). 

The Center for Auto Safety (p. 109) gathers information and complaints concerning safety defects, recalls, service bulletins, and state &ldquo;lemon&rdquo; laws. 

[[renting]]

=== Renting

Before renting a car: 


*  Ask what the total cost will be after all fees are included. There may be an airport surcharge or fees for drop-off, insurance, fuel, mileage, taxes, additional-drivers, underage-driver, and equipment rental (for items such as ski racks and car seats). See drip pricing on p. 2. 


*  Ask whether the rental company checks the driving records of customers when they arrive at the counter. If so, you could be rejected, even if you have a confirmed reservation. 


*  Check in advance to be sure you aren&rsquo;t duplicating insurance coverage. If you&rsquo;re traveling on business, your employer may have insurance that covers accidental damage to the vehicle. You might also have coverage through your personal auto insurance (p. 32), a motor club membership, or the credit card you use to reserve the rental. 


*  Carefully inspect the vehicle and its tires before renting and when you return it. Try to return the car during regular hours so you and the rental staff can look at the car together to verify that you didn&rsquo;t damage it. 


*  Check refueling policies and charges. 


*  Pay with a credit card rather than a debit card, to avoid holds on the funds in your checking account. See &ldquo;Before You Swipe Your Debit Card&rdquo; (p. 6). 


*  Ask the rental company whether a deposit is required. If so, ask for a clear explanation of the deposit refund policies and procedures. 

For more information about renting a car and the insurance options, visit link:$$http://www.insureuonline.org/consumer_auto_car_rental_insurance.htm$$[www.insureuonline.org/consumer_auto_car_rental_insurance.htm]. 

Some state laws cover short-term car and truck rentals. Contact your state or local consumer protection office (p. 112) for information or to file a complaint. 

[[repairs]]

=== Repairs

Whenever you take a car to the repair shop: 


*  Choose a reliable repair shop. Family, friends, or an independent consumer-rating organization should be able to help you. Look for shops that display various certifications that are current. You should also check out the shop&rsquo;s record with your state or local consumer protection office (p. 112) or the Better Business Bureau (p. 67). 
+
Describe the symptoms. Don&rsquo;t try to diagnose the problem. 


*  Make it clear that work cannot begin until you have an estimate (in writing, preferably) and you give your okay. Never sign a blank repair order. If the problem can&rsquo;t be diagnosed on the spot, insist that the shop contact you for authorization once it has found the trouble. 


*  Ask the shop to return the old parts to you. 


*  Follow the warranty instructions if a repair is covered under warranty. 


*  Get all repair warranties in writing. 


*  Keep copies of all paperwork. 

Some states, cities, and counties have special laws that deal with auto repairs. For information on the laws in your state, contact your state or local consumer protection office (p. 112). A consumer guide to auto repair is available at link:$$http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/autos/aut13.shtm$$[www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/autos/aut13.shtm]. 

[[car_repossessions]]

=== Car Repossessions

When you borrow money to buy a car or truck, the lender can take your vehicle back if you miss a payment or in some other way violate the contract. You should also be aware that the lender: 


*  Can repossess with cause without advance notice 


*  Can insist you pay off the entire loan balance to get the repossessed vehicle back 


*  Can sell the vehicle at auction 


*  Might be able to sue you for the difference between the vehicle&rsquo;s auction price and what you owe 


*  Cannot break into your home or physically threaten someone while taking the vehicle 

If you know you&rsquo;re going to be late with a payment, talk to the lender. If you and the lender reach an agreement, be sure to get the agreement in writing. Contact your state or local consumer protection office (p. 112) to find out whether your state gives you any additional rights.
