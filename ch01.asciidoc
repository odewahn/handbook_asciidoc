=== Before You Buy

 To avoid problems and make better decisions, use this checklist BEFORE you make a purchase: 


*  Decide in advance exactly what you want and what you can afford. 


*  Do your research. Ask family, friends, and others you trust for advice based on their experience. Gather information about the seller and the item or service you are purchasing. 


*  Review product test results and other information from consumer experts. See Key Information Resources (p. 59) or check the _Handbook_ index (p. 147) for specific information. 


*  Get advice and price quotes from several sellers. 


*  Make sure the seller has all appropriate licenses. Doctors, lawyers, contractors, and other service providers must register with a state or local licensing agency. 


.Drip Pricing
****
 Have you ever planned to make a purchase, only to find out that there are additional, sometimes mandatory, fees that weren&rsquo;t included in the advertised price? The total cost is not revealed until the end of the purchasing process. If so, you have been the victim of drip pricing. This practice makes it difficult for consumers to determine the full cost and compare similar options, when all the fees aren&rsquo;t disclosed up front. You can protect yourself by reading the policies before completing the sale and asking questions of sales personnel. Also, if you have charged your purchase on your credit card, you may be able to dispute the extra fees if they are more than you had agreed to with the seller. 


****



*  Check out a company&rsquo;s complaint record with your local consumer affairs office (p. 112) and Better Business Bureau (p. 67). 


*  Get a written copy of guarantees and warranties. 


*  Get the seller&rsquo;s refund, return, and cancellation policies. 


.Quick Tips for Avoiding Fraud
****
 There are many varieties of consumer fraud, but the most common ones are variations of fake check scams, credit repair, free trip offers, and sweepstakes. Here are some tips to help you avoid being a victim: 


*  _Don&rsquo;t give out personal information_. Be suspicious of anyone you don&rsquo;t know who asks for your Social Security number, birthdate, credit card number, bank account number, password, or other personal data. 


*  _Don&rsquo;t be intimidated_. Be suspicious of calls or e-mails that want you to provide or verify personal information immediately. Answer that you&rsquo;re not interested and hang up or don&rsquo;t reply to the e-mail. 


*  _Monitor your accounts_. Review bank and credit card statements carefully, and report unauthorized transactions to your financial institution immediately. 


*  _Use a shredder._ Tear or shred credit offers, bank statements, insurance forms, and other papers with personal information. 


****



*  Ask whom to contact if you have a question or problem. 


*  Read and understand any contract or legal document you are asked to sign. Make sure there are no blank spaces. Insist that any extras you are promised be put in writing. 


*  Consider paying by credit card. If you have a problem, you can dispute a charge made on your credit card (p. 13). 


*  Don&rsquo;t buy on impulse or under pressure; this includes donating to charity. 

[[service_contracts_and_extended_warranties]]

=== Service Contracts And Extended Warranties

 Service contracts or &ldquo;extended warranties&rdquo; can add hundreds of dollars to your purchase price, but they are rarely worth the cost. Some duplicate warranty coverage you get automatically from a manufacturer or dealer. Ask these questions before you agree to one of these contracts: 


*  Does the dealer, the manufacturer, or an independent company back the service contract? 


*  How are claims handled? Who will do the work, and where will it be done? 


*  What happens to your coverage if the dealer or administrator goes out of business? 


*  Do you need prior authorization for repair work? 


*  Are there any situations when coverage can be denied? You may not have protection from common wear and tear, or if you fail to follow recommendations for routine maintenance. 

[[product_safety_recalls]]

=== Product Safety Recalls

 Before you buy a used vehicle or other second-hand product, check to be sure that it hasn&rsquo;t been recalled for safety reasons. Some recalls ban the sale of an item, while others ask consumers to return the item for replacement or repair. Sometimes, a seller will provide a part that reduces the danger of using the product. 

 If you&rsquo;re buying a product for a child, be especially careful. Each year, there are approximately 100 recalls of children&rsquo;s products such as toys, clothing, cribs, and costume jewelry. Visit the websites in the &ldquo;Check Here for Recalls&rdquo; box to find the latest safety recalls. You can also sign up for free e-mail notifications at link:$$http://www.cpsc.gov/cpsclist.aspx$$[www.cpsc.gov/cpsclist.aspx] or download the app from link:$$http://www.Recalls.gov$$[www.Recalls.gov] on your mobile phone. 

[[identifying_and_stopping_fraud]]

=== Identifying And Stopping Fraud

 Look for these warning signs to avoid fraud: 


*  You are asked for your bank account or credit card number. 


*  Someone you don&rsquo;t know offers you the chance to receive a credit card, loan, prize, lottery, or other valuable item, but asks you for personal data to claim it. 


*  The solicitation looks like a government document and suggests that contest winnings or unclaimed assets are yours for a small fee. (The government doesn&rsquo;t solicit money from citizens.) 


*  Someone you don&rsquo;t know asks you to send money or money orders to claim a prize, lottery, credit card, loan, or other valuable offer. 


*  An unknown caller claiming to be a lawyer or in law enforcement offers to help you get your money back (for a fee). 


*  The deal is only good &ldquo;for today&rdquo; or a short time. 


*  A &ldquo;repair person&rdquo; suddenly finds a dangerous defect in your car or home. 


*  You are given little or no time to read a contract. 


*  A sale item is suddenly unavailable, but a &ldquo;much better item&rdquo; is available for slightly more money. 


*  Someone is trying to scare you into making a purchase.

[[shopping_from_home]]

=== Shopping From Home

 Late delivery, shipment of wrong or damaged items, and hidden costs are common complaints when consumers shop from home. To avoid problems and resolve them more easily, follow the advice in the Before You Buy checklist (p. 2). In addition, here are some general tips: 


*  _Be wary of post office boxes_ and sellers in other countries. It may be difficult to find the seller to resolve a problem later. 


*  _Know the total price._ Make sure it includes all charges, shipping, handling, insurance, and taxes. Coupons and other discounts should be deducted properly.

*  _Make sure you are clear on what you are buying._ Watch for words such as &ldquo;refurbished,&rdquo; &ldquo;reconditioned,&rdquo; &ldquo;closeout,&rdquo; or &ldquo;discontinued.&rdquo; 


*  _The security code_ on the back of your credit card offers you extra protections on online purchases. 


*  _Keep a record of your purchase._ Save any information the seller gives you, such as order confirmation number, product description, delivery date, cancellation policy, privacy policy, warranties, and order confirmation numbers. 


*  _Keep track of your order._ If it&rsquo;s late, you have the right to cancel and demand a refund. 


==== Your Rights

 When you order something by mail, phone, or online, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires the company to: 


*  Ship the merchandise within the time promised, or if no specific delivery time was stated, within 30 days of receiving your order. 


*  Notify you if the shipment cannot be made on time and give you the option of waiting longer or getting a refund. 


*  Cancel your order and return your payment if the new shipping date cannot be met, unless you agree to another delay. 

 If you cancel your order, your money must be refunded within seven days (or your account must be credited within one billing cycle if you charged the order). The company can&rsquo;t substitute a store credit. If you applied for a charge account with the merchant at the same time that you placed your order, the company has an extra 20 days to ship the merchandise to allow time for processing your application. 

 These FTC rules only apply to the first shipment of magazine subscriptions or other merchandise you receive repeatedly. Orders for services (for example, photo finishing), sale of seeds and growing plants, and collect-on-delivery (C.O.D.) orders, are covered by a different FTC rule. Your state may also have rules that apply. Report suspected violations to your state or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and to the FTC (p. 107). 


.Online and Group Coupons
****
 In addition to the traditional coupons found in newspapers, coupons can be found online. They may be found on manufacturers&rsquo;, companies&rsquo;, dedicated coupon, or social media websites. 

 Group coupons are another online saving tool. Local companies offer reduced prices for things like spa services, gourmet meals, and outdoor adventures through a third-party company; then you pay the third-party company to take advantage of the deal. Group coupons allow you to try new experiences by reducing the trial cost. Before you purchase a group coupon, ask yourself, &ldquo;Am I really going to use this?&rdquo; If the answer is no, don&rsquo;t buy it. 

 Read the terms and conditions of all coupons for expiration dates or use limitations.

==== 3-Day Cooling-Off Rule

 This federal law, which dates back to 1972, protects consumers in their homes during door-to-door sales pitches or at sales in temporary business locations. According to the FTC, the 3-Day Cooling-Off Rule does NOT apply to the purchase of new automobiles or items sold online. It only applies when a company is selling something that costs $25 or more at a location other than its regular place of business. 

 To comply with the 3-Day Cooling-Off Rule, a seller must inform buyers of their right to cancel the sale and receive a full refund within three business days. 

 Be aware that there are situations in which the Cooling-Off Rule does not apply: 


*  You made the purchase entirely by mail, online, or telephone. 


*  The sale was the result of prior contact you had at the seller&rsquo;s permanent business location. 


*  You signed a document waiving your right to cancel. 


*  Your purchase is not primarily for personal, family, or household use. 


*  You were buying real estate, insurance, securities, or a motor vehicle. 


*  You can&rsquo;t return the item in a condition similar to how you received it. 


*  You bought arts or crafts at a fair, shopping mall, civic 

 center, or school. Remember, if you paid by credit card and are having difficulty getting your refund, you may also be able to dispute the charge with your credit card company under the Fair Credit Billing Act. See Credit Card Billing Disputes (p. 13). 


==== Online shopping

 Online shopping websites often offer great deals, variety, and convenience. However, consumers need to be careful and make informed decisions about their purchases. Some tips for shopping safely online: 


*  Stick to websites that are known or recommended. 


*  Compare prices and deals, including free shipping, extended service contracts, or other offers. 


*  Search for online coupons, known as promo codes, which may offer discounts or free shipping. Some sites offer promo codes for coupons to be used in bricks-and-mortar stores. 


*  Get a complete description of the item and parts included, and the price, including shipping, delivery time, warranty information, return policy, and complaint procedure. 


*  Before you finalize the order, double check the quantity and total price are correct. 


*  Pay with a credit card. Federal law protects you if you need to dispute charges, but it doesn&rsquo;t apply to debit cards, checks, cash, money orders, or other forms of payment. 


*  Use a secure browser. Look for an address that starts with &ldquo;https&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;http.&rdquo; Also look for a closed padlock icon, usually in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. 


*  Avoid making online purchases on public WiFi hotspots; these may not be secure, and your payment information could be stolen over the network. See WiFi (p. 41) for more information. 


*  Print your purchase order with details of the product and your confirmation number. For more information, go to link:$$http://www.onguardonline.gov$$[www.onguardonline.gov]. 


==== Online Auctions and Sellers

 Many people sell items on the Internet through auctions, classified ads, news groups, and chat rooms. Review the Internet section (p. 41) for safe shopping online as well as the general tips on shopping from home (p. 3). When participating in an online auction, remember to: 


*  Check how the auction works. Can you cancel a bid? Don&rsquo;t assume that the rules one auction site uses apply to another. Some sites offer step-by-step instructions that will take you through the bidding process. 


*  Find out what protections you have. Does the site provide free insurance or guarantees for items that are not delivered or are not what the seller claimed? 


*  Follow the strategies used in any auction. Learn the value of the item before you begin bidding, then establish your top price and stick to it. 


*  Read past customers&rsquo; ratings to determine if the seller is reputable and delivered quality products, as promised. 


*  Only bid on an item if you intend to buy. If you&rsquo;re the highest bidder, you have bought it. Auction companies often bar those who back out of a deal from future bidding. 


*  If the seller can&rsquo;t accept payment by credit card, use an escrow service. A third party holds your money until you get your purchase and approve release of your payment to the seller. There is a small fee, but the peace of mind is worth it. 

 For more tips, contact the Federal Trade Commission at link:$$http://www.ftc.gov$$[www.ftc.gov]. 

[[after_you_buy]]

=== After You Buy

 Even careful buyers can run into unforeseen problems later on. To minimize them, follow these steps after you buy: 


*  Save all papers that come with your purchase. Keep all contracts, sales receipts, canceled checks, owner&rsquo;s manuals, and warranty documents. 


*  Read and follow product and service instructions. The way you use or take care of a product might affect your warranty rights. 

 If you have a problem with the item you purchased, file a complaint (p. 55).
