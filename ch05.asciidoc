=== Paying For College 101

Many state governments have created 529 plans that make it easier for families to save for their child&rsquo;s education. These plans, which can be sponsored by states or institutions of higher learning, encourage saving for future college costs, and the earnings grow tax-free. There are two main types: &ldquo;pre-paid tuition plans&rdquo; and &ldquo;college savings plans.&rdquo; Pre-paid plans allow you to pay for your child&rsquo;s college tuition based on today&rsquo;s costs, and then pay out at the future (higher) cost once your child is in college. College savings plans allow you to invest money in several investment funds, ranging in risk level, to pay for your child&rsquo;s college education. For more information about the different types of 529 plans and the plans available in each state, visit link:$$http://www.collegesavings.org$$[www.collegesavings.org]. 


.Beware: Scholarship and Financial Aid Scams
****
Scholarships and financial aid do not require up-front fees. While there are legitimate companies that will help guide you through the financial aid and college application process for a fee, disreputable companies may ask you for money up front and provide nothing in return. Red flags to watch out for include the following: 


*  A &ldquo;money-back guarantee&rdquo; to secure a scholarship. Don&rsquo;t believe it. Unscrupulous companies attach conditions that make it impossible to get the refund. 


*  &ldquo;Secret scholarships.&rdquo; If a company claims to have inside knowledge of scholarship money, it&rsquo;s lying. Information on scholarships is freely available to the public. Ask your librarian or school counselor. 


*  Telling students they&rsquo;ve been selected as &ldquo;finalists&rdquo; for awards. 


*  Asking for a student&rsquo;s checking account to &ldquo;confirm eligibility.&rdquo; If a company wants bank account information or your credit card number to confirm or reserve a scholarship, it&rsquo;s a scam. 


*  Quoting a relatively small &ldquo;monthly&rdquo; or &ldquo;weekly&rdquo; fee, then asking for authorization to debit your checking account for an unspecified length of time. Ongoing fees are a sure sign of a scam. 


*  Unsolicited offers. Whether it&rsquo;s an e-mail or phone call, or it arrives in your mailbox, if you didn&rsquo;t request the information, ignore the offer.

==== Financial Aid

Student financial aid is available from a variety of sources, including the federal government, individual states, colleges and universities, and other public and private agencies and organizations. The four basic types of college aid are: 


*  __Grants.__ Gift aid that does not have to be repaid and is generally awarded according to financial need. 


*  _Work-Study._ The Federal Work-Study Program (FWS) is a federally funded source of financial assistance used to offset financial education costs. Students who qualify earn money by working while attending school. This money does not have to be repaid. 


*  _Loans._ Funds are borrowed and must be repaid with interest. As a general rule, federal student loans have more favorable terms and lower interest rates than traditional consumer loans do. 


*  _Scholarships._ Funds are offered by the school, local/ community organizations, private institutions, and trusts. Scholarships do not have to be repaid and are generally awarded based on specific criteria.

==== Defaulting on Student Loans

You can take steps to avoid defaulting on your student loan. Before you get the loan, determine how much money you need to borrow and only borrow that amount. When you get the loan, make certain that you understand the details such as the payment terms and what type of loan you have. Once your student loan becomes due: 


*  Maintain accurate records of your loan, including the loan agreement, interest rates, and account numbers. 


*  Track your loans to stay updated on how much you owe. 


*  Make certain that the loan servicer has your current contact information and bank account (if payments are withdrawn automatically). 

If you default, it means you failed to make payments on your student loan as scheduled. Your loan becomes delinquent the first day after you miss a payment. However, the loan isn&rsquo;t in default until 270 days have passed without a payment. The consequences of default can be severe, including: 


*  The entire unpaid balance of your loan and any interest is immediately due and payable. 


*  Your loan account is assigned to a collection agency. 


*  The loan will be reported as delinquent to credit bureaus, damaging your credit. 


*  Your federal and state taxes may be withheld through a tax offset. This means that the Internal Revenue  Service can take your federal and state tax refund to collect any of your defaulted student loan debt. 


*  Your employer can withhold money from your pay and send the money to the government. This process is called wage garnishment. 

If you are having difficulty making your payments, contact your loan servicer immediately. The servicer may be able to help by changing your repayment plan, switching the due date, getting a deferment or forbearance, or consolidating your student loans.
