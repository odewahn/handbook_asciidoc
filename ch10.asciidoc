 When choosing among housing options, there are many decisions you must make. Should you rent or buy? If you buy, what sort of financing should you choose, and what type of mortgages is best for you? The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds housing counseling agencies throughout the country to help you make these decisions. These organizations can give you advice on buying a home, renting, defaults, foreclosures, credit issues, and reverse mortgages. To contact the agency nearest you, call 1-800-569-4287 or visit link:$$http://www.hud.gov$$[www.hud.gov]. Homeowners with problems that could result in default on their mortgage or foreclosure on their property are encouraged to contact a HUD-approved housing counseling agency immediately. 

 If you believe you are being discriminated against during your housing search because of your race, color, nationality, religion, sex, familial status, or disability, contact HUD&rsquo;s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (p. 102). 


=== Buying A Home

 Buying a home is one of the most complex financial decisions you&rsquo;ll ever make. In addition to the financial and legal issues involved, real estate agents and lenders may not be acting in your best interest. 


*  Real estate agents represent the seller, not the buyer. Consider hiring a buyer&rsquo;s agent who works for you, not for the seller. 


*  Get prices on other homes. Knowing the price of other homes in a neighborhood will help you avoid paying too much. 


*  Have the property inspected. Use a licensed home inspector to inspect the property carefully before you agree to buy it. 


*  Check to see if a particular home requires you to pay any ongoing homeowners association or condo fees.

==== Mortgages

 When shopping for a home mortgage, make sure you obtain all of the relevant information: 


*  Research current interest rates. Check the real estate section of your local newspaper, use the Internet, or call at least six lenders for information. 


*  Check the rates for 15-year, 20-year, and 30-year mortgages. You may be able to save thousands of dollars in interest charges by getting the shortest-term mortgage you can afford. 


*  Ask for details on the same loan amount, loan term, and type of loan from multiple lenders so you can compare the information. Be sure to get the APR, which takes into account not only the interest rate, but also points, broker fees, and other credit charges expressed as a yearly rate. 


*  Ask whether the rate is fixed or adjustable. The interest rate on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) can vary a great deal over the lifetime of the mortgage. An increase of several percentage  points might raise payments by hundreds of dollars per month. 


.Underwater/Upside-down Mortgages
****
 When describing a mortgage in trouble, the terms &ldquo;underwater&rdquo; or &ldquo;upside-down&rdquo; mean the same thingâ€” when the amount of money you still have to pay on the loan is more than the actual value of the loan. For more information about underwater or upside-down mortgages, visit  link:$$http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/programs/fallen-value-help$$[www.makinghomeaffordable.gov/programs/fallen-value-help]. 


****



*  If a loan has an adjustable rate, ask when and how the rate and loan payment can change. 


*  Find out how much of a down payment is required. Some lenders require 20% of the home&rsquo;s purchase price as a down payment. But many lenders now offer loans that require less. In these cases, you may be required to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI) to protect the lender if you fall behind on payments. 


*  If PMI is required, ask what the total cost of the insurance will be. How much will the monthly mortgage payment be when the PMI premium is added, and how long you will be required to carry PMI? 


*  Ask whether you can pay off the loan early, and whether there  is a penalty for doing so.  

 There is a long list of sources for mortgage loans: mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, banks, thrifts and credit unions, home builders, real estate agencies, and Internet lenders.

==== Mortgage Transfers

 CFPB rules help mortgage borrowers by requiring that mortgage companies notify them when their loans are transferred to another company. The rules ensure that you know who owns your loan, which is important information if you have questions or payment disputes or want to discuss loan modifications. 

 Under these rules, the company that takes over your loan must send you a notice within 30 days of acquiring it. Even with a new loan owner, the company that &ldquo;services&rdquo; or handles your loan might not change, and you might continue to send your mortgage payments to the same address. If that loan servicer changes, you will receive a separate notice. 

 For more information about servicing companies, read the FTC&rsquo;s publication, Mortgage Servicing: Making Sure Your Payments Count at link:$$http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/homes/rea10.shtm$$[www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/]consumer/homes/rea10.shtm. 


=== Avoiding Foreclosure

 If you miss your mortgage payments, foreclosure may occur. This is the legal means your lender can use to repossess your home. If you owe more than your property is worth, a deficiency judgment is pursued. Both foreclosures and deficiency judgments have a negative impact on your future credit. You should avoid foreclosure if at all possible.

 Fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are the two main types of mortgages, but there is a wide variety of other mortgage products available. Below are pros and cons of some of the mortgage products you want to consider: 

[options="header"]
|===============
|Type of Mortgage|Pros|Cons
| Fixed-rate mortgage | No surprises. Interest rate stays the same over the entire term, usually 15, 20, or 30 years. | If interest rates fall, you could be stuck paying a higher rate. 
| Adjustable-rate (ARM) or variable-rate mortgage | Usually offers a lower initial rate of interest than fixed-rate loans. | After an initial period, rates fluctuate over the life of the loan. When interest rates rise, generally so do your loan payments. 
| FHA (Federal Housing Administration) loans | Allows buyers who may not qualify for a home loan to obtain one with a low down payment. | The size of your loan may be limited. 
| VA loan | Guaranteed loans for eligible veterans, active duty personnel, and surviving spouses. Offers competitive rates, low or no down payments. | The size of your loan may be limited. 
| Balloon mortgage | Usually a fixed-rate loan with relatively low payments for a fixed period. | After an initial period, the entire balance of the loan is due immediately. This type of loan may be risky for some borrowers. 
| Interest-only | Borrower pays only the interest on the loan in monthly payments for a fixed term. | After an initial period, the balance of the loan is due. This could mean higher payments, paying a lump sum, or refinancing. 
| Reverse mortgage | Allows seniors to convert equity in their homes  to cash; you don&rsquo;t have to pay back the loan and  interest as long as you live in the house. | Subject to aggressive lending practices  and false advertising promises, particularly  by lenders that prey on seniors. Check to  make sure the loan is Federally insured.

.Mortgage Refinancing
****
 Consider refinancing your mortgage if you can get a rate that is at least one percentage point lower than your existing mortgage rate and if you plan to keep the new mortgage for several years. When comparing mortgages, don&rsquo;t forget to include the extra fees you must pay for the new mortgage. You may be able to get some fees waived if you are able to refinance with your current mortgage holder. 

 In addition, the Making Home Affordable Program offers opportunities to modify or refinance your mortgage to make your monthly payments more affordable. It also includes the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program for homeowners who are interested in a short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Visit link:$$http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov$$[www.makinghomeaffordable.gov] or call 1-888-995HOPE (4673).

 *These steps can help:* 


*  Do not ignore letters from your lender. If you&rsquo;re having problems making your payments, call or write to your lender&rsquo;s Loss Mitigation Department immediately. Explain your situation. Be prepared to provide financial information, such as your monthly income and expenses. Without this information, the lender may not be able to help you. 


*  Stay in your home for now; you may not qualify for assistance if you abandon your property. 


*  Contact a HUD-approved housing counselor. Call 1-800-569-4287 or TDD 1-800-877-8339 for the housing counseling agency nearest you. These agencies are valuable resources. 


*  Contact Making Home Affordable for help. Call 1-888-995-4673, or 1-877-304-9709 for hearing-impaired homeowners, to talk to a HUD-approved credit counselor who will guide you through your options for free. 

 HUD counselors frequently have information on services and programs offered by government agencies as well as private and community organizations that could help you. The housing counseling agency may also offer credit counseling. These services are usually free of charge. 

 For more information, contact The U.S. Department of 

 Housing and Urban Development (p. 102). Additional advice, resources, and tips for homeowners can be found under Home Equity Loans (p. 16), Insurance (p. 33), and Home Improvement and Repairs (p. 29). 


=== Moving Companies

 Not all moving companies are the same. Although many are legitimate, some attempt to take advantage of their clients. Follow these guidelines to help you choose the right mover: 

 _Get a written estimate from several movers._ Be wary of very low estimates. Some companies quote a low price to get a contract and later ask for more money before they will remove your belongings from their truck. 

 _Make sure the mover has an operating license._  For moves from one state to another, visit link:$$http://www.protectyourmove.gov$$[www.protectyourmove.gov] to verify a mover&rsquo;s license. For moves within a state, check your state, county, or local consumer affairs agency (p. 112). 

 _Make sure the mover has insurance._ If furniture is damaged during the move, the mover&rsquo;s insurance should cover it. Ask how to file a complaint if there are limits to the coverage. For more information about the levels of mover&rsquo;s insurance coverage, visit link:$$http://www.protectyourmove.gov/consumer/awareness/valuation/valuation-insurance.htm$$[www.protectyourmove.gov/consumer/awareness/valuation/valuation-insurance.htm]. 

 _Check the mover&rsquo;s record._ Contact your state or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) or the Better Business Bureau (p. 67) to see whether there is a history of complaints. 

 If you have a dispute with a moving company, you can file a complaint with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration by calling 1-888-368-7238 or by visiting link:$$http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov$$[www.fmcsa.dot.gov]. 


=== Home Improvement And Repairs

 Home improvements and repairs can cost thousands of dollars and are the subject of frequent complaints. When selecting a contractor: 


*  Get recommendations and references. Talk to friends, family, and others who have used the contractor for similar work. 


*  Get at least three written estimates. Insist the contractors come to your home to evaluate what needs to be done. Be sure the estimates are based on the same work so you can make meaningful comparisons. 


*  Check contractor complaint records with your state or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) or the Better Business Bureau (p. 67). 


*  Make sure the contractor meets licensing and registration requirements. Your state or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) can help you determine the necessary requirements. 


*  Get the names of suppliers and ask them whether the contractor makes timely payments. 


*  Contact your local building inspection department to check for permit and inspection requirements. Be wary if the contractor asks you to get the permit; it could mean the firm is not licensed. 


*  Be sure your contractor is insured. The contractor should have personal liability, property damage, and workers&rsquo; compensation insurance for workers and subcontractors. Also check with your insurance company to find out whether you are covered for any injury or damage that might occur. 


.ï»¿Beware: Foreclosure Rescue Scams
****
 Scam artists often target homeowners who are struggling to meet  their mortgage commitment or are anxious to sell their homes.  Recognize and avoid common scams: 


*  *Lease-back or rent-to-buy scams:*  You are asked to transfer  the title to your home &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo; to the scam artist who  promises to obtain better financing for your mortgage and  allow you to stay in your home as a renter with the option  to purchase the home back. However, if you do not comply  with the terms of the rent-to-buy agreement, you will lose  your money and be evicted like any other tenant. 


*  *Fake &ldquo;government&rdquo; modification programs:*  These scams claim to be affiliated with the government or  require that you pay high fees to benefit from government  modification programs. Remember that you do not have to pay  any fees to participate in government-approved programs. Some  frauds may even use words like &ldquo;Federal&rdquo; or &ldquo;government-approved&rdquo;  or acquire website names that make consumers think they are  associated with the government. 


*  *Refinance fraud:* The scam  artist offers to be an intermediary between you and your  mortgage lender to negotiate a loan modification. The scam  artist may even instruct you to make payments directly to  him or her, which the scammer will send to the lender.  However, the scam artist will not forward the payments  to your lender and you could still lose your home. 


*  *&ldquo;Eliminate your debt&rdquo; claims:*  Some companies may make false legal claims that you are  not required to repay your mortgage or that they know  of &ldquo;secret laws&rdquo; that can eliminate your debt. Do not  believe these claims. 


*  *Refinance scams:* You  are encouraged to sign &ldquo;foreclosure rescue&rdquo; loan documents  to refinance your loan. In reality, you have surrendered  ownership of your home because the loan documents are  actually deed transfer documents. You may falsely believe  that your home has been saved from foreclosure until you  receive an eviction notice months or even years later. 

 Remember: Foreclosure assistance from a HUD-approved housing  counselor is free. Visit link:$$http://www.makinghomeaffordable.gov$$[www.makinghomeaffordable.gov] or call 1-800-569-4287.

*  Insist on a written contract that states exactly what work will be done, the quality of materials that will be used, warranties, timetables, the names of any subcontractors, the total price of the job, and the schedule of payments. 


*  Try to limit your down payment. Some states have laws limiting the amount of down payment required. 


*  Understand your payment options. Compare the cost of getting your own loan versus contractor financing. 


*  Don&rsquo;t make a final payment or sign a final release until you are satisfied with the work and know that subcontractors and suppliers have been paid. Some state laws allow unpaid subcontractors and suppliers to put a lien on your home for bills the contractor failed to pay. 


*  Pay by credit card when you can. You may have the right to withhold payment to the credit card company until problems are corrected (see p. 13). 

 _Be especially cautious if the contractor:_ 


*  Comes door-to-door or seeks you out 


*  Just happens to have material left over from a recent job 


*  Offers you discounts for finding other customers 


*  Quotes a price that&rsquo;s out of line with other estimates 


*  Pressures you for an immediate decision 


*  Can only be reached by leaving messages with an answering service 


*  Asks you to pay for the entire job up front 

 With most home improvements, federal law gives you three business days to cancel without penalty. See the 3-Day Cooling-Off Rule (p. 4). Of course, you would be liable for any benefit already received. State laws may also provide some protection. And remember, if you finance home improvements with a home equity loan (p. 16) and don&rsquo;t make your payments, you could lose your home. 


=== Renting/Leasing

 A lease is an agreement that outlines the obligations of the owner and the tenants of a house or apartment. It is a legally binding document that courts will generally uphold in legal proceedings, so it is important for you to know the exact terms of the lease agreement before you sign it. Before agreeing to lease an apartment to you, a landlord may review your credit report, so you may want to get a copy before you start your apartment search. Some things to look for in a lease: 


*  Clauses that allow the landlord to change the terms of the lease after it is signed 


*  Requirements/responsibilities of the tenants to do routine repairs such as lawn maintenance, cleaning, or notification about needed repairs 


*  Restrictions that would prevent you from living normally or comfortably in the home 


*  Terms of the lease and any important dates such as when the rent is due or garbage pickup days 


*  Extra fees for parking spaces or storage, garbage collection, and pets 


*  Information regarding utility providers, how to arrange for service and whether the landlord or tenant is responsible for paying the bills (see Utilities, p. 52) 

 Read the lease carefully and discuss anything you don&rsquo;t understand or any issues you might have. All landlord responsibilities should be stated clearly. Always get a copy of the signed lease to keep in your records. Any clause or terms in the agreement affects ALL parties who sign. 

 Check with the Better Business Bureau (p. 67) or your local consumer protection office (p. 112) to determine if your prospective landlord has any existing complaints from previous tenants. 

 The Fair Housing Act protects tenants who lease or rent property. If you think your rights have been violated, you may write a letter to or call the HUD office nearest you (p. 102). You have  one year after the alleged violation to file a complaint with HUD, but you should file as soon as possible. 

 Each state has its own set of tenant rights, laws, and protections. For a state-by-state directory, visit link:$$http://www.hud.gov/local$$[www.hud.gov/local]. You can also find available public housing at link:$$http://www.hud.gov$$[www.hud.gov]. HUD (p. 102) offers several housing assistance programs for tenants and landlords as well as information on rights of residents and displaced tenants. 


==== Ten Tips for Renters


.  The best way to win over a prospective landlord is to be prepared by bringing a completed rental application with you; written references from previous landlords, employers, friends, and colleagues; and a current copy of your credit report. 


.  Carefully review all of the important conditions of the tenancy before you sign. 


.  To avoid disputes or misunderstandings with your landlord, get everything in writing. 


.  Ask about your privacy rights before you sign the lease. 


.  Know your rights to live in a habitable rental unitâ€” and don&rsquo;t give them up. 


.  Keep communication open with your landlord. 


.  Purchase renters insurance to cover your valuables. See more information under Homeowners/Renters Insurance (p. 33). 


.  Make sure the security deposit refund procedures are spelled out in your lease or rental agreement. 


.  Learn whether your building and neighborhood are safe, and what you can expect your landlord to do if they aren&rsquo;t. 


.  Know when to fight an eviction notice and when to move. Unless you have the law and provable facts on your side, fighting an eviction notice is usually shortsighted.
