=== Emergency Preparedness

 Disasters can strike in many forms—fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and even national emergencies. Protecting yourself, your family, your pets, and your home or your business requires advance planning. It is equally important to know where to turn for help and information. You may even be eligible for government assistance. 


.Services And Resources For Consumers With Disabilities

.Predatory Lending Restrictions
****
 As of October 1, 2007, the Talent-Nelson Amendment to the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act allows the Department of Defense to regulate the terms of payday loans, vehicle title loans, and tax refund loans to active-duty service members and their dependents. These three products have high interest rates, coupled with short payback terms. 

 The rule for service members and their dependents limits the Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) on these loans to 36%. All fees and charges should be included in calculating the rate. The rule also prohibits contracts requiring the use of a check or access to a bank account, mandatory arbitration, or unreasonable legal notice. Any credit agreement subject to this regulation that fails to comply with the regulation is void and cannot be enforced. The rule further provides that a creditor or assignee that knowingly violates the regulation shall be subject to certain criminal penalties. 

 The Department of Defense strongly encourages service members and their families to choose alternatives that specifically help resolve financial crises, rebuild credit ratings, and establish savings for emergencies. Payday loans, vehicle title loans, and tax refund loans can propel an already overextended borrower into a deeper spiral of debt.
