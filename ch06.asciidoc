 Times have changed for job searching, and numerous websites are now available that post private industry jobs. Many companies also offer a way to apply online. However, these sites and new methods do not replace traditional and proven job-hunting approaches such as networking, personal contacts, business organizations, and interviewing.

=== Employment Agencies and Recruiters

 If you&rsquo;re looking for a job, you may come across ads from employment agencies or receive calls from recruiters that promise wonderful opportunities. While some companies honestly want to help you, others are more interested in taking your money. Be wary of: 


*  Promises to get you a job and a guaranteed income 


*  Up-front fees, even when you are guaranteed a refund if you are dissatisfied 


*  Employment agencies whose ads read like job ads 


*  Promotions of &ldquo;previously undisclosed&rdquo; government jobs. All federal jobs are announced to the public at link:$$http://www.usajobs.gov$$[www.usajobs.gov]. 

 Get a copy of the employment agency contract and review it carefully before you pay any money. Check with your local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and the Better Business Bureau (p. 67) to see whether any complaints have been filed about a company. 

 The FTC (p. 107) investigates businesses that fraudulently advertise employment openings and guarantee job placement. Contact the FTC if you have a complaint. 


=== Work-at-Home Companies

 Not all work-at-home opportunities deliver on their promises. Some classic work-at-home schemes are medical billing, envelope stuffing, and assembly or craftwork. Ads for these businesses say, &ldquo;Be part of one of America&rsquo;s Fastest-Growing Industries. Earn thousands of dollars a month from your home!&rdquo; Legitimate work-at-home program sponsors should tell you, in writing, what&rsquo;s involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions you might ask a promoter: 


.Credit Checks: A New Part of the Hiring Process
****
 Are you in the market for a new job? If so, remember that potential employers aren&rsquo;t just reading your résumé; they are also reviewing your credit history. Before you apply for any job, get your free credit report (see p. 12) for information about your credit history, including: 


*  If you pay your bills on time or late 


*  How much money you owe 


*  If someone has sued you 

 Before a potential employer can request your credit report or use it, the company must notify you and ask your permission. And if a company decides not to hire you because of information in your credit report, it must tell you (orally or in writing), along with information about the credit reporting company and your rights to dispute the accuracy of the report.

*  What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program sponsor to list every step of the job.) 


*  Will I be paid a salary, or will my pay be based on commission? 


*  When will I get my first paycheck? 


*  What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment, and membership fees? What will I get for my money? 

 The answers to these questions may help you determine whether a work-at-home program is appropriate for your circumstances and whether it is legitimate. 


==== Multilevel Marketing

 Some multilevel marketing plans are legitimate; however, others are illegal pyramid schemes. In pyramids, commissions are based on the number of distributors recruited. Most of the product sales are made to these distributors, not to consumers in general. The underlying goods and services, which vary from vitamins to car leases, only make the schemes look legitimate. Most people end up with nothing to show for their money except the expensive products or marketing materials they were pressured to buy for resale. 

 If you&rsquo;re thinking about joining what appears to be a legitimate multilevel marketing plan, take time to learn about the plan: 


*  What is the company&rsquo;s track record? 


*  What products does it sell? 


*  Does it sell products to the public at large? 


*  Does it have the evidence to back up the claims it makes about its product? 


*  Is the product competitively priced? 


*  Is it likely to appeal to a large customer base? 


*  How much does it cost to join the plan? 


*  Are monthly minimum sales required to earn a commission? 


*  Will you be required to recruit new distributors to earn your commission? 


==== Net-Based Business Opportunities

 The FTC says that many Internet business opportunities are scams that promise more than they can possibly deliver. These companies lure would-be entrepreneurs with false promises of big earnings for little effort. Some tips for finding a legitimate opportunity: 


*  Consider the promotion carefully. 


*  Study the business opportunity&rsquo;s franchise disclosure document. 


*  Get earnings claims in writing and compare them with the experience of previous franchise and business opportunity owners. 


*  Visit previous franchise and business opportunity owners in person, preferably at their places of business. 


*  Check out the company with the local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and Better Business Bureau (p. 67) to see  whether there have been any complaints. 


*  If the business opportunity involves selling products from well-known companies, verify the relationship with the legal department of the company whose merchandise you would promote. 


*  Consult an attorney, accountant, or other business advisor before you put any money down or sign any papers. 


*  Take your time. Promoters of fraudulent business opportunities are likely to use high-pressure sales tactics to get you to buy in. If the business opportunity is legitimate, it will still be around when you&rsquo;re ready to decide. 


=== Unemployment

 The government&rsquo;s Unemployment Insurance Program provides benefits to eligible workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own and who meet other eligibility requirements.
