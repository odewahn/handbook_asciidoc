Like everything else you buy, it pays to comparison shop for credit. For up-to-date interest rate reports on mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, home equity loans, and other banking products, visit link:$$http://www.bankrate.com$$[www.bankrate.com]. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act protects you when dealing with anyone who regularly offers credit, including banks, finance companies, stores, credit card companies, and credit unions. When you apply for credit, a creditor may not: 


*  Ask about or consider your sex, race, national origin, or religion 


*  Ask about your marital status or your spouse—unless you are applying for a joint account or relying on your spouse&rsquo;s income, or you live in a community property state (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, or Wisconsin) 


*  Ask about your plans to have or raise children 


*  Refuse to consider public assistance income or regularly received alimony or child support 


*  Refuse to consider income because of your sex or marital status or because it is from part-time work or retirement benefits 

*You have the right to:* 


*  Have credit in your birth name, your first name and your spouse/partner&rsquo;s last name, or your first name and a combined last name 


*  Have a co-signer other than your spouse if one is necessary 


*  Keep your own accounts after you change your name or marital status or if you retire, unless the creditor has evidence that you are unable or unwilling to pay 


*  Know why a credit application is rejected—the creditor must give you the specific reasons or tell you where and how you can get a copy of the credit report it used to determine its rejection, if you ask within 60 days 


*  Have accounts shared with your spouse reported in both of your names 


*  Know how much it will cost to borrow money 

For additional information on credit, see Buying a Home (p. 27)  and Cars (p. 8). Other sources of information include the HUD Housing Counseling Clearinghouse at 1-800-569-4287, the FTC (p. 107), and the National Consumer Law Center (p. 110).

[[credit_cards]]

=== Credit Cards

There are many types of credit cards with various features, but there is no one best credit card. The card you use depends entirely on how you plan to use it. Are you going to use it for everyday purchases or larger purchases? Do you plan to pay your balance off each month? 

When you apply for a credit card, consider: 


*  *Annual Percentage Rate (APR)*. If the interest rate is variable, how is it determined, and when can it change? 


*  *Periodic rate*. This is the interest rate used to determine the finance charge on your balance each billing period. 


*  *Annual fee*. While some cards have no annual fee, others expect you to pay an amount each year for being a cardholder. 


*  *Rewards programs.*Can you earn points for flights, hotel stays, and gift certificates to your favorite retailers? Use the tool on link:$$http://www.creditcardtuneup.com$$[www.creditcardtuneup.com]to find the card that offers the best rewards for you. 


*  *Grace period*. This is the number of days you have to pay your bill before finance charges start. Without this period, you may have to pay interest from the date you use your card or the date the purchase is posted to your account. 


*  *Finance charges*. Most lenders calculate finance charges using an average daily account balance, which is the average of what you owed each day in the billing cycle. Look for offers that use an adjusted balance, which subtracts your payment from your beginning balance. This method usually has the lowest finance charges. Check whether there is a minimum finance charge. 


*  *Other fees*. Ask about fees when you get a cash advance, make a late payment, or go over your credit limit. Some credit card companies also charge a monthly fee. Be careful: sometimes companies may also try to upsell by offering other services such as credit protection, insurance, or debt coverage. Visit link:$$http://www.federalreserve.gov/creditcard/fees.html$$[www.federalreserve.gov/creditcard/fees.html] for more information.

.Card Act Protections For Consumers
****
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act brought about sweeping protections for consumers. Among other things, your credit card company must comply with the rules below: 

*Fees* 


*  Cannot change rates or fees without sending you a notice 45 days in advance in most cases 


*  Cannot charge you a late payment fee of more than $25, regardless of how much you owe—unless one of your last six payments was late or the credit card company can justify a higher fee based on the cost of late payments 

*Payments* 


*  Has to tell you how long it will take to pay off your balance if you make only minimum payments 


*  Must mail or deliver your credit card bill at least 21 days before your payment is due 

*Interest Rates* 


*  Cannot increase your rate for the first 12 months after you open an account unless you have a variable interest rate or an introductory rate; you are more than 60 days late paying your bill; or you are in a workout agreement and don&rsquo;t make payments as arranged 


*  Cannot charge higher rates for purchases made before you receive  notice of a new rate 

What&rsquo;s more, a credit card company can grant credit cards to consumers under age 21 only if they can show they are able to make payments or have a cosigner for the card. More information about CARD Act protections is available from link:$$http://www.federalreserve.gov/creditcard$$[www.federalreserve.gov/creditcard]. 


****


The Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act requires credit and charge card issuers to include this information on credit applications. The Federal Trade Commission (p. 107) offers a wide  range of free publications on credit and consumer rights at link:$$http://www.ftc.gov$$[www.ftc.gov]. 

There are many websites available to help you compare credit cards; link:$$http://www.bankrate.com$$[www.bankrate.com] provides free credit card tips and information and link:$$http://www.cardratings.com$$[www.cardratings.com] lists and reviews credit cards, and offers tips and credit card calculators. 

To view an interactive version of a sample credit card bill, visit link:$$http://www.federalreserve.gov/creditcard$$[www.federalreserve.gov/creditcard]. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) provides useful  information for consumers on selecting a credit card appropriate  for their needs. See &ldquo;How do I Shop for a Credit Card,&rdquo; on the  CFPB website, link:$$http://www.consumerfinance.gov/how-do-i-shop-for-a-credit-card$$[www.consumerfinance.gov/how-do-i-shop-for-a-credit-card]. 


==== Complaints

To complain about a problem with your credit card company, call the number on the back of your card or try to resolve it with the CFPB (p. 96). If you fail to resolve the issue, ask for the name, address, and phone number of the card company&rsquo;s regulatory agency. See the chart on page 7 to find the best federal or state regulatory agency to contact. 

To complain about a credit bureau, contact the CFPB; for complaints about a department store that offers credit, or other Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured financial institution, write to the agency&rsquo;s Consumer Response Center (p. 106). You may also file a complaint with the FTC at link:$$http://www.ftc.gov$$[www.ftc.gov]. 


==== Credit Card Billing Disputes

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, you have the right to dispute charges on your credit card that you didn&rsquo;t make, are incorrect, or are for goods or services you didn&rsquo;t receive. 


*  Send a letter to the creditor within 60 days of the statement date of the bill with the disputed charge. 


*  Include your name and account number, the date and amount of the disputed charge, and a complete explanation of why you are disputing the charge. To ensure it&rsquo;s received, send your letter by certified mail, with a return receipt requested. 


*  The creditor or card issuer must acknowledge your letter in writing within 30 days of receiving it and conduct an investigation within 90 days. You do not have to pay the amount in dispute during the investigation. 


*  If there was an error, the creditor must credit your account and remove any fees. 


*  If the bill is correct, you must be told in writing what you owe and why. You must then pay it, along with any related finance charges. 

If you don&rsquo;t agree with the creditor&rsquo;s decision, file an appeal with the CFPB (p. 96). 

[[credit_reports_and_scores]]

=== Credit Reports And Scores

A credit report contains information on where you work and live, how you pay your bills, and whether you&rsquo;ve been sued or arrested or have filed for bankruptcy. Credit reporting agencies (CRAs) gather this information and sell it to creditors, employers, insurers, and others. The most common type of CRA is the credit bureau. There are three major credit bureaus: 


*  Equifax: 1-800-685-1111 or link:$$http://www.equifax.com$$[www.equifax.com]. To place a fraud alert on your credit report, call 1-888-766-0008. 


*  Experian: 1-888-397-3742 or link:$$http://www.experian.com$$[www.experian.com] 


*  TransUnion: 1-877-322-8228 or link:$$http://www.transunion.com$$[www.transunion.com] or  fraud alert 1-800-680-7289 

The CFPB is now responsible for overseeing the credit reporting agencies and receive complaints about them (p. 96). 


.Beware: &ldquo;Credit Repair&rdquo; Scams
****
Before you sign up for fee-based credit repair services, beware. Many of the promised services are either illegal or are ones you can do for free by yourself. Before you sign up to work with these companies, here are some tidbits to keep in mind: 


* A credit repair company must give you a copy of the &ldquo;Consumer Credit File Rights under State and Federal Law&rdquo; before you sign a contract.


* The company cannot perform any services until you have signed a written contract and completed a threeday waiting period, during which time you can cancel the contract without paying any fees.


* The company cannot charge you until it has completed the promised services, according to the Credit Repair Organizations Act.


* It is illegal to erase timely and accurate negative information contained in your credit history.


* Suggestions that you create a new credit history (also called file segregation) by requesting an Employer Identification Number from the IRS are also illegal.


* You can solve your own credit challenges by requesting a free copy of your credit report through link:$$http://www.annualcreditreport.com$$[www.annualcreditreport.com],  and by working with creditors to dispute incorrect information. 


****



==== FICO

The information in your credit report is used to calculate your FICO score, a number generally between 300 and 850. The acronym  stands for Fair, Isaac and Company. The higher your score, the less risk you pose to creditors. A high score, for example, makes it easier for you to obtain a loan, rent an apartment, or lower your insurance rate. Your FICO score is available from link:$$http://www.myfico.com$$[www.myfico.com]for a fee. Free credit reports do not contain your credit score, although you can purchase it when you request your free annual credit report through link:$$http://www.annualcreditreport.com$$[www.annualcreditreport.com]. 


==== Tips for Building a Better Credit Score


*  Pay your bills on time. Delinquent payments and collections negatively affect your score. 


*  Keep balances low on credit cards and other &ldquo;revolving credit.&rdquo; High outstanding debt lowers your score. 


*  Apply for and open new credit accounts only as needed. Don&rsquo;t open an account just to have a better credit mix; it probably won&rsquo;t raise your score. 


*  Pay off debt instead of moving it around. Owing the same amount, but having fewer open accounts, may lower your score. 

You don&rsquo;t rebuild your credit score; you rebuild your credit history. Time is your ally in improving credit. There is no &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; for a bad credit score, so be suspicious of any deals that offer you a fast, easy solution. 


==== Negative Information in Your Credit Report

Negative information concerning your use of credit can be kept in your credit report for seven years. A bankruptcy can be kept for 10 years, and unpaid tax liens for 15 years. Information about a lawsuit or an unpaid judgment against you can be reported for seven years or until the statute of limitations runs out, whichever is longer. Inquiries remain on your report for two years. 


.Debt Collection E-mails
****
When communicating with consumers through email, debt collectors must observe the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). It is important for you and creditors or collection agencies to save and store copies of all communication, which will be important if there is a disagreement later. 

To take steps towards maintaining privacy, conduct all communications  via email using either secure email platforms or industry-specific  communication platforms. Never give a workplace email account as  a contact address, as there is no legal expectation of privacy  for a workplace email account.


****


Anyone who denies you credit, housing, insurance, or a job as a result of a credit report must give you the name, address, and telephone number of the CRA that provided the report. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you have the right to request a free report within 60 days if a company denies you credit based on the report. 

If there is inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit report: 


*  Contact the CRA and the company that provided the information. 


*  Tell the CRA in writing what information you believe is inaccurate. Keep a copy of all correspondence. 

Under the FCRA, the information provider is required to investigate and report the results to the CRA. If the information is found to be incorrect, FCRA must notify all nationwide CRAs to correct your file. If the investigation does not solve your dispute, ask that your statement concerning the dispute be  included in your file. A notice of your dispute must be included  whenever the CRA reports the negative item. 


.Lost and Stolen Credit Cards
****
Immediately call the card issuer when you suspect a credit or charge card has been lost or stolen. Once you report the loss or theft of a card, you have no further responsibility for unauthorized charges. In any event, your maximum liability under federal law is $50 per card. 


****


If the information is accurate, only time, hard work, and a personal debt repayment plan will improve your credit report. Credit repair companies advertise that they can erase bad credit for a hefty fee. Don&rsquo;t believe it. Under the Credit Repair Organizations Act, credit repair companies can&rsquo;t require you to pay until they have completed promised services. They must also give you: 


*  A copy of the &ldquo;Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law&rdquo; before you sign a contract 


*  A written contract that spells out your rights and obligations 


*  Three days to cancel without paying any fees 

Some credit repair companies promise to help you establish a whole new credit identity. You can be charged with fraud if you use the mail or telephone to apply for credit with false information. It is also a federal crime to make false statements on a loan or credit application, to give a false Social Security number, or to obtain an Employer Identification Number from the Internal Revenue Service under false pretenses. If you have lost money to a credit repair scam, contact your state or local consumer affairs office (p. 112). 

[[dealing_with_debt]]

=== Dealing with Debt

If you want to reduce your amount of debt, you can do some work on your own. First, develop a realistic budget so you can see your income and expenses in one place and look for ways to save money. For help in creating a budget, visit link:$$http://www.mymoney.gov$$[www.mymoney.gov] or link:$$http://www.consumer.gov/articles/1002-making-budget#!what-it-is.$$[www.consumer.gov/articles/1002-making-budget#!what-it-is.] Also, contact your creditors and inform them that you are having difficulty making payments; they may be able to modify your payment plan. 


==== Debt Collection

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applies to those who collect debts owed to creditors for personal, family, and household expenditures. These debts include car loans, mortgages, charge accounts, and money owed for medical bills. A debt collector is someone hired to collect money you owe. 

Within five days after a debt collector first contacts you, the collector must send you a notice that tells you the name of the creditor, how much you owe, and what action to take if you believe you don&rsquo;t owe the money. If you owe the money or part of it, contact the creditor to arrange for payment. If you believe you don&rsquo;t owe the money, contact the creditor in writing and send a copy to the collection agency with a letter telling it not to contact you. 

A debt collector may not: 


*  Contact you at unreasonable times, for example, before 8 am or after 9 pm, unless you agree 


*  Contact you at work if you tell the debt collector your employer disapproves 


*  Contact you after you write a letter telling the collector to stop, except to notify you if the collector or creditor plans to take a specific action 


*  Contact your friends, relatives, employer, or others, except to find out where you live and work 


*  Harass you with repeated telephone calls, profane language, or threats to harm you 


*  Make any false statement or claim you will be arrested 


*  Threaten to have money deducted from your paycheck or to sue you, unless the collection agency or creditor intends to do so and it is legal 

To file a complaint about a debt collection company, contact your state or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and the FTC (p. 107). 


==== Credit Counseling Services

Counseling services are available to help people budget money and pay bills. Credit unions, extension offices, military family service centers, and religious organizations are among those that may offer free or low-cost credit counseling. 

Local, nonprofit agencies that provide educational programs on money management and help in developing debt payment plans operate under the name Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS). Make certain that the agency is accredited by the Council on Accreditation (COA) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The counselor should also be certified by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC), an organization that supports a national network of credit counselors. 


.Peer-to-Peer Lending
****
Peer to peer lending (P2P), or social lending, is a new process of connecting an individual borrower with lenders, without using traditional banks to obtain an unsecured loan. As a potential borrower, you can post a request for a loan, along with a brief description of how you will use it. The borrower and lenders are strangers; their only knowledge of each other is through the P2P website. Although the idea seems very informal, a peer-to-peer loan contract is a formal, legally binding agreement between two parties; checks and pay stubs are required. There can still be fees for late and missed payments. The lenders must report your loan payment history to the credit reporting agencies. For more information about peer-to-peer lending, visit link:$$http://www.consumeraction.org/news/articles/2012_p2p_lending_survey/#primer$$[www.consumeraction.org/news/articles/2012_p2p_lending_survey/#primer]. 


****


Typically, a counseling service will negotiate lower payments with your creditors, and then make the payments using money you send to it each month. The cost of setting up this debt-management plan is paid by the creditor, not you. Ask these questions to find the best counselor for you: 


*  What services do you offer? Look for an organization that offers budget counseling and money management classes as well as debt-management planning. 


*  Do you offer free information? Avoid organizations that charge for information or make you provide a lot of details about your problem first. 


*  What are your fees? Are there set-up and/or monthly fees? A typical set-up fee is $10. Beware of agencies that charge large up-front fees. 


*  How will the debt-management plan work? What debts can be included in the plan, and will you get regular reports on your accounts? 


*  Ask whether the counselor can get creditors to lower or eliminate interest and fees. If the answer is yes, contact your creditors to verify this. 


*  Ask what happens if you can&rsquo;t afford to pay. If an organization won&rsquo;t help you because you can&rsquo;t afford to pay, go somewhere else for help. 


*  Will your counselor help you avoid future problems? Getting a plan for avoiding future debt is as important as solving the immediate debt problem. 


*  Ask for a contract. All verbal promises should be in writing before you pay any money. 


*  Are your counselors accredited or certified? Legitimate credit counseling firms are affiliated with the NFCC (p. 145) or the  Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies  (p. 143).  

Check with your local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and the Better Business Bureau (p. 67) to see whether any complaints have been filed about the counseling service you&rsquo;re considering. 

If you have concerns about approved credit counseling agencies or credit counseling providers, please contact the U.S. Trustee Program at link:$$http://www.justice.gov/ust$$[www.justice.gov/ust] or call 202-514-4100. 


==== Personal Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy generally is considered the debt management option of last resort because the results are long-lasting and far-reaching. The Bankruptcy Abuse and Prevention Act of 2005 established more stringent rules for consumers and attorneys. 

The filing process may be difficult for debtors: 


*  Debtors must file documents, including itemized statements of monthly net income, proof of income (pay stubs) for the last 60 days, and tax returns for the preceding year (four years for Chapter 13 bankruptcies). 


*  Debtors must take a pre-filing credit counseling and post-filing education course to have debts discharged. To find an approved credit counseling provider, visit link:$$http://www.justice.gov/ust$$[www.justice.gov/ust]. 


*  Debtors face increased filing fees, plus fees for credit counseling/education. 


*  The bankruptcy petition and process are complicated, so it&rsquo;s very difficult to file without an attorney. However, attorneys are more apprehensive about filing bankruptcy because of sanctions. 

The filing process for lawyers: 


*  An attorney&rsquo;s signature on a petition certifies that the attorney has performed reasonable investigation into circumstances giving rise to the petition. 


*  Attorneys must carefully review documents such as tax returns and pay stubs and ask clients for credit reports. 

[[loans]]

=== Loans

There are different types of loans. Some are secured loans. This mean that your property and things you own are used as collateral, and if you cannot pay back the loan, the lender will take your collateral to get their money back. Other types of loans, unsecured loans, don&rsquo;t use property as collateral. Lenders consider these as more risky than secured loans, so they charge a higher interest rate for them. Most credit cards are unsecured loans, although some consumers have secured credit cards. Two very common secured loans are home equity and installment loans. 


==== Home Equity Loans

A home equity loan is a form of credit where your home is used as collateral for the loan. This type of loan is often used to pay for major expenses, such as education, medical bills, and home repairs. Consider carefully before taking out a home equity loan. If you are unable to make payments on time, you could lose your home. 

Home equity loans can be either a revolving line of credit or a lump sum. Revolving credit lets you withdraw funds when you need them. A lump sum is a one-time, closed-end loan for a particular purpose, such as remodeling or tuition. Apply for a home equity loan through a bank or credit union first. These loans are likely to cost less than those offered by finance companies. 

Please see Housing (p. 27) for helpful information about buying, leasing, renting, or repairing a home.


==== Installment Loans

Installment loans are loans that are repaid over time with a set number of scheduled payments; the most common installment loans are home or car loans. Before you sign an agreement for a loan to buy a house, a car, or other large purchase, make sure you fully understand all of the lender&rsquo;s terms and conditions, including: 


*  The dollar amount you are borrowing 


*  The payment amounts and when they are due 


*  The total finance charge, including all interest and fees you must pay to get the loan 


*  The APR, the rate of interest you will pay over the full term of the loan 


*  Penalties for late payments 


*  What the lender will do if you can&rsquo;t pay back the loan 


*  Penalties if you pay the loan back early 

The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to give you this information so you can compare different offers. 


.Payday and Tax Refund Loans
****
Payday loans are designed to stretch your budget until your payday. Beware; these loans charge high annual interest rates and excessive fees that are due every few weeks. Because of these excessive fees, payday loans are illegal in some states and for all members of the military. With a typical payday loan, you might write a personal check for $115 to borrow $100 for two weeks, until payday. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) in this example is 390%! If you can repay the loan quickly, it may not appear to be such a bad deal. But if you have to renew the loan, that relatively small loan can grow into a major debt. 

Another high-cost way to borrow money is a tax refund loan. This type of credit lets you get an advance on a tax refund—for a fee. APRs as high as 774% have been reported. If you&rsquo;re short of cash, avoid both of these loans by asking for more time to pay a bill or seeking a traditional short-term bank loan.
