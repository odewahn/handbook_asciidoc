General sources of insurance information include the American Council of Life Insurers (p. 142), the Insurance Information Institute (p. 144), the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (p. 145), and your state insurance department (p. 130). You can also visit link:$$http://www.insure.com$$[www.insure.com]. 

When buying any type of insurance (home, life, auto, rental, or other), you should: 


*  Find out whether your state insurance department (p. 130) offers  any information concerning insurance companies and rates. This is a good way to get a feeling for the range of prices and the lowest-cost providers in your area. 


*  Check several sources for the best deal. Try getting quotes online, but be aware that many online services may provide prices for just a few companies. An independent insurance agent who works with several insurers in your area may be able to get you a better deal. 


*  Make sure the insurance company is licensed and covered by the state&rsquo;s guaranty fund. The fund pays claims in case the company defaults. Your state insurance department (p. 130) can provide this information. 


*  Check the financial stability and soundness of the insurance company. Ratings from A.M. Best (link:$$http:www.ambest.com$$[]), Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s (link:$$http:www.standardandpoors.com$$[]), and Moody&rsquo;s Investors Services (link:$$http://www.moodys.com$$[]) are available online and at most public libraries. 


*  Research the complaint record of the company. Contact your state insurance department (p. 130), or visit the website of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (link:$$http:www.naic.org$$[]), which has a database of complaints filed with state regulators. 


*  Find out what others think about the company&rsquo;s customer service. Consumers can rate homeowner insurance companies at link:$$http://www.jdpower.com/insurance$$[www.jdpower.com/insurance]. 


*  Once you pay your first insurance premium, make sure you receive a written policy. This tells you that the agent forwarded your premium to the insurance company. If you don&rsquo;t receive a policy within 60 days, contact your agent and the insurance company. 

If you suspect fraud, call the National Insurance Crime Bureau&rsquo;s hotline, 1-800-835-6422. For more information, check out link:$$http://www.insurancefraud.org$$[www.insurancefraud.org]. 


=== Auto Insurance

The requirements for auto insurance vary from state to state. Check with your state insurance regulator (p. 130) to learn more about individual requirements as well as insurers you may be considering for your policy. 

To get the best coverage at the best price, get several quotes from insurance companies; it may save you hundreds of dollars a year. Other ways to reduce your insurance premium include: 


*  Raise your deductible on collision and comprehensive coverage. If you have an older car, you might want to drop this coverage altogether. 


*  Take advantage of discounts. You may be eligible for a discount based on the number of miles you drive; your age (turning 25 or 50); your good grades if you are a student; your driving record (no moving vehicle violations or accidents in three years); or if you&rsquo;ve taken a safe-driving course. You might also be able to get discounts if you insure more than one vehicle, insure your vehicle and your home with the same company, have anti-theft devices, or have safety features such as air bags or anti-lock brake system. 

You can also find valuable information about car ownership in Cars (p. 11), as well as information about insurance for rental cars. 


=== Disability Insurance

Disability can be more disastrous financially than death. If you are disabled, you lose your earning power, but you still have living expenses and often huge fees for medical care. Disability insurance helps you replace lost income. Many employers offer some type of disability insurance coverage for employees, or you can get an individual disability insurance policy. There are two types of disability policies: short-term disability (STD) and long-term disability (LTD). Short-term disability policies have a maximum benefit of two years, while long-term disability policies have benefits that can last the rest of your life. When purchasing disability insurance, ask: 


*  *How is disability defined?* Some policies consider you disabled if you are unable to perform the duties of any job. Better plans pay benefits if you are unable to do the usual duties of your own occupation. 


*  *When do benefits begin?* Most plans have a waiting period after an illness before payments begin. 


.Insurance Vocabulary

=== Health Insurance


==== Affordable Care Act

The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) puts in place comprehensive health insurance reforms that will roll out over several years. Most provisions will take effect by 2014; a timeline is available at link:$$healthcare.gov/law/timeline$$[healthcare.gov/law/timeline]. The law is intended to lower health care costs, provide more health care choices, and enhance the quality of health care for all Americans. Major provisions affecting consumers include: 


*  Coverage for seniors who hit the Medicare Prescription Drug &ldquo;donut hole,&rdquo; including a rebate for those who reach the gap in drug coverage. 


*  Expanded coverage for young adults, allowing them to stay on their parents&rsquo; plan until they are 26 years old. 


*  Providing access to insurance for uninsured Americans with pre-existing conditions. 


*  Expanded preventive care (for example, wellness visits and mammograms) to Medicare and Medicaid participants. 


*  Medical coverage to children not eligible for care under Medicaid. 


*  In 2013, you can set aside up to $2,500 in a flexible spending account (FSA) for medical expenses that aren&rsquo;t covered by insurance. 

For more information about the law as well as basic information about health insurance, go to link:$$http://www.healthcare.gov$$[www.healthcare.gov]. 


==== Group Policies

Many consumers have health care coverage from their employers. Others have medical care paid through a government program such as Medicare (p. 100), Medicaid (p. 100), or the Veterans Health  Administration (p. 105). 

If you have lost your group coverage from an employer as the result of unemployment, death, divorce, or loss of &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; status, you may be able to continue your coverage temporarily under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA). You, not the employer, pay for this coverage. When one of these events  occurs, you must be given at least 60 days to decide whether you wish to purchase the coverage. 

Some states offer an insurance pool to residents who are unable to obtain coverage  because of a health condition. To find out whether a pool is available in your state, check with your state department of insurance (p. 130).

==== Medicare and Medicaid

There are also health insurance programs for people who are seniors, disabled, or have low incomes. 


*  *Medicaid* provides health insurance for people with low incomes, children, and pregnant women. Eligibility is determined by your state. 


*  *Medicare* provides health insurance for people who are 65 years or older, some younger people with disabilities, and those with kidney failure. 

Contact the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services  (p. 100) for more information on benefits. 

Most states also offer free or low-cost coverage for children who do not have health insurance. Visit link:$$http://www.insurekidsnow.gov$$[www.insurekidsnow.gov] or call 1-877-KIDS-NOW (543-7669) for more information. 


=== Health Care Plans

When purchasing health insurance, your choices typically will fall into one of three categories: 


*  *Traditional* fee-for-service health insurance plans are usually the most expensive choice, but they offer you the most flexibility in choosing health care providers. 


*  *Health maintenance organizations (HMOs)*  offer lower co-payments and cover the costs of more preventive care, but your choice of health care providers is limited. The National Committee for Quality Assurance evaluates and accredits HMOs. You can find out whether one is accredited in your state by calling 1-888-275-7585. You can also get this information, as well as report cards on HMOs, by visiting link:$$http://www.ncqa.org$$[www.ncqa.org]. 


*  *Preferred provider organizations (PPOs)* offer lower co-payments like HMOs, but give you more flexibility in selecting a provider. A PPO gives you a list of providers you can choose from. 

*WARNING: If you go outside the HMO or PPO network of providers, you may have to pay a portion or all of the cost.* 

When choosing among different health care plans, you&rsquo;ll need to read the fine print and ask lots of questions, such as: 


*  Do I have the right to go to any doctor, hospital, clinic, or pharmacy I choose? 


*  Are specialists such as eye doctors and dentists covered? 


*  Does the plan cover special conditions or treatments such as pregnancy, psychiatric care, and physical therapy? 


*  Does the plan cover home care or nursing home care? 


*  Will the plan cover all medications my physician may prescribe? 


*  What are the deductibles? Are there any co-payments? 


*  What is the most I will have to pay out of my own pocket to cover expenses? 


*  If there is a dispute about a bill or service, how is it handled? In some plans, you may be required to have a third party decide how to settle the problem. 


=== Homeowners/Renters Insurance

You may be able to save hundreds of dollars a year on homeowners insurance by shopping around. You can also save money by following these tips: 


*  Consider a higher deductible. Increasing your deductible by just a few hundred dollars can make a big difference in your premiums. 


*  Ask your insurance agent about discounts. You may be able to get a lower premium if your home has safety features such as dead-bolt locks, smoke detectors, an alarm system, storm shutters, or fire-retardant roofing material. Persons over  55 years of age or long-term customers may also be offered discounts. 


*  Insure your house, NOT the land under it. After a disaster, the land is still there. If you don&rsquo;t subtract the value of the land when deciding how much homeowners insurance to buy, you will pay more than you should. 


*  Don&rsquo;t wait until you have a loss to find out whether you have the right type and amount of insurance. 


*  Make certain you purchase enough coverage to replace what is insured. &ldquo;Replacement&rdquo; coverage gives you the money to rebuild your home and replace its contents. An &ldquo;Actual Cash Value&rdquo; policy is cheaper but pays the difference between your property&rsquo;s worth at the time of loss minus depreciation for age and wear. 


*  Ask about any special coverage you might need. You may have to pay extra for computers, cameras, jewelry, art, antiques, musical instruments, stamp collections, etc. 


*  Remember that flood and earthquake damage are not covered by a standard homeowners policy. The cost of a separate earthquake policy will depend on the likelihood of earthquakes in your area. Homeowners who live in areas prone to flooding should take advantage of the National Flood Insurance Program (p. 102). 


*  If you are a renter, do not assume your landlord carries insurance on your personal belongings. Purchase a separate policy for renters. 


=== Life Insurance

Your need for life insurance will change with changes in your life. For example, the arrival of children usually triggers a sharp increase in the amount you will need. As children grow older and leave the nest, you will probably need less protection. You should also consider your life insurance policies as you are planning for retirement (p. 37). 

Term life insurance policies are the least costly. They pay death benefits but have no cash value if you decide to stop making payments. As the word &ldquo;term&rdquo; suggests, these policies are in effect for a specific period—one year or until you reach a certain age are common. Visit link:$$http://www.accuquote.com$$[www.accuquote.com] for online comparisons of term life insurance. 

Whole life, universal life, and other cash value policies combine a long-term savings and investment product with life insurance. Canceling these policies after only a few years can more than double your life insurance costs. 

If you have misplaced a life insurance policy, your state&rsquo;s insurance commission may be able to help you locate it. Or you can search for it at link:$$http://www.policylocator.org$$[www.policylocator.org]. If the insurance company knows that an insured person has died, but cannot locate the beneficiaries, the company must turn the benefits over to the state&rsquo;s unclaimed property office. Check  with that office if you believe that you are due a benefit. 

You can avoid losing your life insurance policy by alerting the policy beneficiaries and filing a copy with your will. 


=== Long-Term Care Insurance

Medical advances have resulted in greater need for nursing home care and assisted living. Most health insurance plans and Medicare severely limit or exclude long-term care. You should consider these costs as you plan for your retirement (p. 37). 

Here are some questions to ask when considering a separate long-term care insurance policy: 


*  *What qualifies you for benefits?* Some insurers say you must be unable to perform a specific number of the following activities of daily living: eating, walking, getting from bed to a chair, dressing, bathing, using the restroom, and remaining continent. 


*  *What type of care is covered?* Does the policy cover nursing home care? What about coverage for assisted-living facilities that provide less client care than a nursing home? If you want to stay in your home, will it pay for care provided by visiting nurses and therapists? What about help with food preparation and housecleaning? 


*  *What will the benefit amount be?* Most plans are written to provide a specific dollar benefit per day. The benefit for home care is usually about half the nursing home benefit, but some policies pay the same for both forms of care. Other plans pay only for your actual expenses. 


*  *What is the benefit period?* It is possible to get a policy with lifetime benefits, but this can be very expensive. Other options for coverage are from one to six years. The average nursing home stay is about 2.5 years. 


*  *Is the benefit adjusted for inflation?* If you buy a policy before age 60, you face the risk that a fixed daily benefit will not be enough by the time you need it. 


*  *Is there a waiting period before benefits begin?*  A 20- to 100-day period is not unusual. See page 26 for more  information about advance medical directives. 


=== Other Insurance


*  *Travel Insurance.* There are four kinds of travel insurance: Travel Cancellation Insurance, Baggage or Personal Effects Coverage, Emergency Medical Coverage, and Accidental Death. To learn more, a helpful website is link:$$http://www.insuremytrip.com$$[www.insuremytrip.com]. See page 49 for additional insight on travel concerns and problems. 


*  *Dental and Vision Insurance.* Some companies that offer health insurance plans may also allow employees to purchase separate dental and vision plans, which are not part of most standard health plans. Contact your state insurance commission (p. 130) or individual insurance companies to find out more about purchasing dental and vision insurance. 


*  *Identity Theft Insurance*. This type of insurance provides reimbursement to crime victims for the cost of restoring their identity and repairing credit reports. Some companies now include this as part of their homeowners insurance policy; others sell it as a standalone policy. Ask your homeowner policy company for information. 


*  *International Health Care Insurance*. A policy that provides health coverage no matter where you are in the world. The policy term is flexible, so you can purchase it only for the time you will be out of the country. Contact your current health care provider for coverage information. 


*  *Catastrophic Health Care Insurance*. A health plan that only covers certain types of expensive care, like hospitalizations. 


*  *Liability Insurance*. Insurance for what the policyholder is legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury or property damage caused to another person. Search online or ask your personal insurance agent for more information. 


*  *Umbrella Insurance*. A policy that supplements the insurance you already have for home, auto, and other personal property. Umbrella insurance can help cover costs that exceed the limits of other policies.
