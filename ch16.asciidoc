Whether reserving a hotel room, buying plane tickets, or making other travel arrangements, these tips will help you get the deal you&rsquo;ve been promised: 


*  _Plan as far ahead as you can._ Special deals on hotel rooms and airline seats often sell out very quickly. 


*  _Be flexible in your travel plans._ Hotels usually offer better rates on days when they expect fewer guests. Once you get a fare quote from an airline, ask if you can save money by leaving a day earlier or later, by taking a different flight on the same day, or by using a different airport. Changing planes during your trip is sometimes cheaper than a nonstop flight. 


*  _Check out the seller._ Ask tour operators and travel agents whether they belong to a professional association, then check to see if they are members in good standing. Contact your state or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) and the Better Business Bureau (p. 67) to find their complaint history. 


*  _Comparison shop._ Determine the complete cost of the trip in dollars, including all service charges, taxes, processing fees, etc. 


*  _Beware of unusually cheap prices and freebies._ These could be a scam, and you could end up paying more than the cost of a regular package tour. See information on Drip Pricing on p. 2. 


*  _Make sure you understand the terms of the deal._ If you hear you&rsquo;ve won a free vacation, ask whether you have to buy something in order to get it. If the destination is a beach resort, ask the seller how far the hotel is from the beach. Then ask the hotel. 


*  _Ask about cancellation policies._ You may want to look into travel insurance for added protection (see 34). The website link:$$http://www.insuremytrip.com$$[www.insuremytrip.com] offers pricing and policy information on plans from different companies and describes the different forms of policies available. 


*  _Insist on written confirmations._ Ask for written proof of reservations, rates, and dates. 


*  _Pay by credit card._ It&rsquo;s not unusual to make a deposit or even pay in full for travel services before the trip. Paying by credit card gives you the right to dispute charges for services that were misrepresented or never delivered. If a travel agent or service provider says you can&rsquo;t leave for at least two months, be very cautious— the deadline for disputing a credit card charge is 60 days, and most scam artists know this. (See Credit Card Billing Disputes, p. 13). 

In some states, travel sellers must be registered and insured. Advance payments for travel must be placed in an escrow account until services are provided. Prizes or &ldquo;free&rdquo; gifts may also be regulated. Contact your state or local consumer protection agency (p. 112) to find out about your rights and how to file complaints. The American Society of Travel Agents (p. 143) also helps to resolve disputes with member agents. 


=== Resolving Air Travel Problems

No matter how well you plan, you might encounter these common air travel hassles. 


==== Delayed and Canceled Flights

Airline delays caused by bad weather, traffic control problems, and mechanical repairs are hard to predict. If your flight is canceled, most airlines will rebook you on the earliest flight possible to your destination, at no additional charge. If you&rsquo;re able to find a flight on another airline, ask the first airline  to endorse your ticket to the new carrier. This could save you from a fare increase, but there is no rule requiring the airline to do this. 


.Airline Fees
****
Many airlines charge extra fees for checked baggage and some charge for carry-ons. Others charge for advance seat assignments, meals, unaccompanied minors, and other services. The Department of Transportation has ruled that an airline must prominently disclose all mandatory taxes and fees on their websites. The airline must also refund baggage fees if it loses your baggage. In addition, airlines are required to include all government taxes and fees in the advertised price. However, air carriers may still charge optional fees not included in the standard price. Each airline&rsquo;s fee schedule is different, so check with the airline before you head to the airport. For more information, go to link:$$airconsumer.dot.gov/subjects.htm$$[airconsumer.dot.gov/subjects.htm]. 

Keep in mind—using frequent flyer points doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you are exempt from additional fees. When booking a flight using frequent flyer points, airlines may still charge you a booking fee or pet fee. 


****


Each airline has its own policies about what it will do for delayed passengers; there are no federal requirements. If your flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline whether it will pay for meals or a phone call. Contrary to what many people believe, airlines are not required to do so. 


==== Delayed or Damaged Bags

If your bags aren&rsquo;t on the conveyor belt when you arrive, file a report with the airline before you leave the airport: 


*  Insist the airline fill out a form and give you a copy, even if personnel say the bag will be on the next flight. 


*  Get the name of the person who filled out the form and a phone number. 


*  Confirm that the airline will deliver the bag to you without  charge when it&rsquo;s found. 

Some airlines will give you money to purchase a few necessities. If they don&rsquo;t provide you with cash, ask what types of articles are reimbursable and keep all receipts. 

If a suitcase arrives damaged, the airline may pay for repairs if you file a claim immediately (before you leave the airport). If an item can&rsquo;t be fixed, the airline will negotiate to pay you its depreciated value. The same is true for belongings packed inside a suitcase. However, airlines may refuse to pay for damage if it was caused by your failure to pack something properly rather than by the airline&rsquo;s handling. 


==== Lost Bags

If your bag is declared officially lost, you will have to submit a second, more detailed form within a time period set by the airline. The information on the form is used to estimate the value of your lost belongings. Airlines can limit their liability for delay, loss, and damage to baggage; however, they must prominently display a sign that explains the limit. According to the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection and Enforcement (link:$$airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/SA_Baggage_Limits.htm$$[]), the maximum an airline pays on lost bags and their contents is limited to $3,300 per passenger on domestic flights, and approximately $1,500 per passenger for unchecked baggage on international flights. See link:$$http://www.thetravelinsider.info/travelaccessories/lostbaggagerights.htm$$[www.thetravelinsider.info/travelaccessories/lostbaggagerights.htm] for more information on maximum liability, including special rates that change daily. 

If the airline&rsquo;s offer doesn&rsquo;t cover your loss fully, check your homeowners or renters insurance to see whether it covers losses away from home. Some credit card companies and travel agencies also offer optional or even automatic supplemental baggage coverage. 

On those trips when you know you&rsquo;re carrying more than the liability limits, you may want to ask about purchasing &ldquo;excess valuation&rdquo; from the airline when you check in. Of course, there is no guarantee the airline will sell you this protection. The airline may refuse, especially if the item is valuable or breakable. 


==== Overbooked Flights

Selling more tickets than there are seats is not illegal. Most airlines overbook their flights to compensate for &ldquo;no-shows.&rdquo; If there are more passengers than seats just before a plane is scheduled to depart, you can be &ldquo;bumped&rdquo; or left behind against your will. Whether you are bumped may depend on when you officially checked in for your flight, so check-in early. The U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to ask people to give up their seats voluntarily, in exchange for compensation. Airlines decide what to offer volunteers, such as money, a free trip, food, or lodging. 

Federal rules protect you if you are &ldquo;bumped&rdquo; on most flights within the United States and on outbound international flights. Passengers who are bumped involuntarily are protected under Federal Aviation Administration guidelines (link:$$http:www.faa.gov$$[]). If you volunteer to be bumped, your agreement with the airline is not regulated and will depend on negotiating at the gate. 

The airline must give you a written statement describing your rights as well as the airline&rsquo;s boarding priority rules and criteria. If the airline is not able to get you to your final destination within two hours of your original arrival time, you may be entitled to a maximum of $800 compensation if you are delayed (that is, more than two hours for domestic and four hours for international) from your original arrival time. The amount depends on the price of the ticket and the length of the delay. To receive this payment, you must have a confirmed reservation. You must also meet the airline&rsquo;s deadlines for ticketing and check-in. An airline may offer you a free ticket on a future flight in place of a check, but you have the right to insist on a check.

==== Tarmac Delays

Under new federal rules, U.S. airlines operating domestic flights must allow passengers to deplane after a tarmac delay of three hours. The only exceptions allowed are for safety or security, or if air traffic control advises the pilot otherwise. Carriers are also required to provide adequate food and drinking water within two hours of being delayed on the tarmac; they must also maintain operable lavatories and, if necessary, provide medical attention. 

There are other protections as well, such as prohibiting airlines from scheduling chronically delayed flights. For more information, go to link:$$http://www.airconsumer.ost.dot.gov$$[www.airconsumer.ost.dot.gov], and search for Airline Passenger Protections. 


=== Passports

A valid U.S. passport is required to enter and leave most foreign countries. The Passport Services Office provides information and services to American citizens about how to obtain, replace, or change a passport. All American citizens must now have a valid U.S. passport to re-enter the country, regardless of what nations they have been visiting while traveling. For more information on how to get a new passport, visit link:$$http://www.travel.state.gov/passport$$[www.travel.state.gov/passport]. 

Acceptance facilities include many federal, state, and probate courts; post offices; some public libraries; and a number of county and municipal offices. There are also 25 regional passport agencies, and one Gateway City Agency, that serve customers who are traveling within two weeks (14 days), or who need foreign visas for travel. Appointments are required in such cases. 

To obtain a passport for the first time, you need to appear in person at one of 7,000 passport acceptance facilities located throughout the United States with: 


*  Two photographs of you taken within the last six months 


*  Proof of U.S. citizenship 


*  A valid form of photo identification (such as a driver&rsquo;s license) 

Passports can be renewed by mail if the applicant is an adult; however, passports for minors must be renewed in person. Guidelines for renewing passports as well as the appropriate forms can be found at link:$$http://www.travel.state.gov/passport/renew/renew_833.html$$[www.travel.state.gov/passport/renew/renew_833.html].

.Check Bus Safety Records
****
Some travelers have turned to commercial buses as an inexpensive option for traveling long distances. Before planning a trip on a commercial bus or hired motorcoach, you should research the company&rsquo;s record. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) recommends that you contact the company and ask these questions: 


*  Do the drivers hold valid Commercial Driver&rsquo;s Licenses with a &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; endorsement? 


*  Does the company comply with the Department of Transportation&rsquo;s drug and alcohol testing requirements for drivers? 


*  Does the company conduct safety inspections of its buses? 

You can find more information about the FMCSA&rsquo;s (p. 104) bus safety database and interstate travel safety at link:$$http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/pcs/Index.aspx$$[www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/pcs/Index.aspx]. If you want to file a safety complaint, call 1-888-368-7238.
