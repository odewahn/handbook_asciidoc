 If you have a financial goal in mind, such as saving for retirement, paying for college, or buying a new house, then you may decide to invest your money to earn enough to fund your goals. Before you invest, do some homework. What is your tolerance for risk? What do you want to invest in? Stocks? Bonds? Mutual funds? Do you want to open an IRA or buy an annuity? Does your employer offer a 401(k)? Remember, every investment involves some degree of risk. Most securities are not insured by the federal government if they lose money or fail, even if you purchase them through a bank or credit union that offers federally insured savings accounts. Make sure you have answers to all of these questions before you invest: 


*  _How quickly can you get your money back?_ Stocks, bonds, and shares in mutual funds usually can be sold at any time, but there is no guarantee you will get back all the money you paid for them. Other investments, such as limited partnerships, certificates of deposit (CDs), or IRAs, often restrict your ability to cash out your holdings. 


*  _What can you expect to earn on your money?_ While bonds generally promise a fixed return, earnings on most other securities go up and down with market changes. Keep in mind that just because an investment has done well in the past, there is no guarantee it will do well in the future. 


*  _What type of earnings can you expect?_ Will you get income in the form of interest, dividends, or rent? Some investments, such as stocks and real estate, have the potential for earnings and growth in value. What is the potential for earnings over time? 


*  _How much risk is involved?_ With any investment, there is always the risk that you won&rsquo;t get your money back or the earnings promised. There is usually a trade-off between risk and rewardâ€”the higher the potential return, the greater the risk. The federal government insures bank savings accounts and backs up U.S. Treasury securities (including savings bonds). See FDIC on page 106 and the chart on page 7 for regulatory information. Other investment options are not protected. 


*  _Are your investments diversified?_ Some investments perform better than others in certain situations. For example, when interest rates go up, bond prices tend to go down. One industry may struggle while another prospers. Putting your money in a variety of investment options can help to reduce your risk. 


*  _Are there any tax advantages to a particular investment?_ U.S. Savings Bonds are exempt from state and local taxes. Municipal bonds are exempt from federal income tax and, sometimes, state income tax as well. Tax-deferred investments for special goals, such as paying for college and retirement, are available that let you postpone or even avoid paying income taxes.

.Beware: Investment Fraud
****
 Deceptive pitches for investments often misrepresent or leave  out facts to promote fantastic profits with little risk. No  investment is risk-free, and a high rate of return means  greater risk. Before investing, get written information such  as a prospectus or annual report. Beware if a salesperson: 


*  Encourages you to borrow money or cash in retirement funds to invest 


*  Pressures you to invest immediately 


*  Promises quick profits 


*  Says the disclosure documents required by federal law are just a formality 


*  Tells you to write false information on your account form 


*  Sends material with typos or misspellings or not printed on letterhead 


*  Does not send your money promptly 


*  Offers to share inside information 


*  Uses words such as &ldquo;guarantee,&rdquo; &ldquo;high return,&rdquo; &ldquo;limited offer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;as safe as a CD&rdquo; 


*  Claims that &ldquo;off-shore investments are tax-free and confidential&rdquo; 

 If you need more information or have an investment advisor problem you are  unable to resolve directly, you can contact the SEC (p. 108) or FINRA (p. 144).

=== Online Trading

 Stocks can be bought and sold with a mouse click from a wide range of online brokers, often with low transaction fees. However, the price of some stocks can instantly go from high to low. Online trading is quick and easy, but online investing requires research and takes time. Before you trade, ask questions and learn how to limit losses in this fast-moving marketplace by: 


*  Knowing what you&rsquo;re buying 


*  Understanding why you&rsquo;re buying or selling 


*  Being aware of how quickly trading changes during fast markets 

 Like other purchases, you should set a price limit, to avoid buying or selling at prices above or lower than you wanted. For more detailed information about online investing, visit link:$$http://www.investor.gov$$[www.investor.gov]. 


=== Financial Brokers and Advisors

 When selecting a broker or investment advisor, research the person&rsquo;s education and professional history as well as the firm the person works for. Ask: 


*  Has the person worked with others who have circumstances similar to yours? 


*  Is the person licensed in your state? Your state securities regulator (p. 134) lists individuals and firms that are registered in your state. Ask whether the regulatory office has any other background information. You can find out how to reach your state securities regulator by visiting link:$$http://www.nasaa.org$$[www.nasaa.org]. 


*  Has the person had any run-ins with regulators or received serious complaints from investors? Call your local state securities regulator or the SEC (p. 108). You can also check out link:$$http://www.finra.org/brokercheck$$[www.finra.org/brokercheck] to find licensing, employment, and disciplinary information. 


*  How is the person paid? Is it an hourly rate, a flat fee, or a commission that depends on the investments you make? Does the person get a bonus from his or her firm for selling you a particular product? 


*  What are the fees for setting up and servicing your account? 

 _Additional organizations that could be helpful are:_ 


*  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) provides consumer alerts and advisories. Visit link:$$http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection$$[www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection]. The CFTC oversees the Reparations Program that resolves disputes between commodity customers and commodity professionals. You can institute &ldquo;reparations&rdquo; proceedings against commodity professionals registered with the CFTC if they violate the anti-fraud or other provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act. To ask a question, report information, or submit a complaint, contact the CFTC (p. 108). 


*  Both the North American Securities Administrators Association and the National Futures Association (p. 146) can offer helpful information. 


*  FINRA (p. 144) provides a dispute resolution program among investors, brokers, and brokerage firms. 


=== Investing in Gold and Commodities

 Many financial experts recommend buying gold as part of a balanced portfolio. Some suggest buying only a small amount because values can fluctuate; others recommend larger investments. 

 There are a number of ways to invest in precious metals; common ones include bullion, certificates, and coins. Most people depend on an investment advisor or company to help them choose. Make sure the person or company you choose is licensed with your state securities administrator (p. 134). If you&rsquo;re considering investing in gold, check the U.S. Mint website at link:$$http://www.usmint.gov$$[www.usmint.gov]. Before you purchase coins or coin-related products, research the seller with your state consumer protection office (p. 112) or Better Business Bureau (p. 67). 

 Commodity futures are an agreement to buy or sell a specific quantity of metals, grains, or other foods. Anyone who trades or gives advice to the public about futures must be registered with the National Futures Association (NFA). The CFTC also provides additional information about investing in gold and other commodities at link:$$http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/CFTCFraudAdvisories$$[www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FraudAwarenessPrevention/CFTCFraudAdvisories.] 


=== Retirement Planning

 Part of smart investing is planning for retirement. The average American spends 20 years in retirement, but fewer than half of Americans calculate how much they need to save for their retirement years. Regardless of your age, it&rsquo;s never too early or too late to start. 

 The three major components of a retirement portfolio are generally benefits from pensions, savings and investments, and Social Security. 

 If you are still working and your employer offers a plan, find out how it works. If your employer has a 401(k) plan and offers to put some money in if you do (called a match), this should be the first place where you save. Make sure you understand how a job change might affect your employer-based retirement plan and what your options are for saving that money. If you switch jobs before you are fully vested, you may lose a significant amount of money.

            |
              Also known as
              fixed-income securities because the income they pay is

 As you approach retirement, there are many factors to consider. Experts advise that you will need about 80% of your pre-retirement income in your retirement years. The exact amount, of course, depends on your individual needs (see Elder Care, p. 25). For example: 


*  Will your spouse or partner retire when you do? 


*  Where do you plan to live? Will you downsize, own, or rent? 


*  Will you have the same medical insurance you had while working? Will coverage change? 


*  Do you want to travel or pursue a new hobby that might be costly? 


*  If you have a financial advisor, talk to him or her about your plans. 

 In addition to planning to maintain your lifestyle during retirement, you may need to purchase long-term health insurance (p. 34) or to pay for assisted-living services (p. 25).
