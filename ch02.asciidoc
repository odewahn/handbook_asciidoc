== Banking



image::images/pdf5131_img_9.png[]

Choosing a bank is a major decision, and there is no one right choice for all consumers. When you shop for a bank, you have to consider the actual products and services it provides as well as the location of branches, size of the bank, fees, and interest rates. Even if you conduct most transactions online or at automated teller machines, you want to choose a bank with quality customer service. Also, consider the variety of products that the bank provides; some banks may specialize in checking and savings accounts, while others are full-service banks, offering loans and CDs. You don&rsquo;t have to maintain all of your accounts at one bank; you can have relationships with several to get the best rates on different services. 


.Protect Your Pin
****
Beware of &ldquo;shoulder surfers.&rdquo; Be suspicious of anyone lurking around an ATM or watching over your shoulder while you use your card. Some thieves even put a device over the card slot of an ATM to read the magnetic strip and record your PIN; this is known as &ldquo;skimming.&rdquo; If you suspect criminal activity, walk away and use a different ATM.

=== ATM/Debit Cards

With a debit card and personal identification number (PIN), you can use an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to withdraw cash, make deposits, or transfer funds between accounts. Some ATMs charge a fee if you are not a member of the ATM network or are making a transaction at a remote location. 

Retail purchases can also be made with a debit card. You enter your PIN or sign for the purchase. Although a debit card looks like a credit card, the money for the purchase is transferred immediately from your bank account to the store&rsquo;s account. When you use a debit card, federal law does not give you the right to stop payment; you must resolve problems directly with the seller. 

If you suspect your debit card has been lost or stolen, call the card issuer immediately. While federal law limits your liability for a lost or stolen credit card to $50, your liability for unauthorized use of your ATM or debit card can be much greater, depending on how quickly you report the loss. 


*  If you report a debit card missing before it is used, you are not responsible for any unauthorized withdrawals. 


*  Your liability is limited to $50 if you report the loss within two business days after you realize your debit card is missing and increases to $500 if you report the loss between two and 60 days. 


*  If you have not reported an unauthorized use of a debit or ATM card within 60 days after your bank mails the statement documenting the unauthorized use, you could lose all of the money in your bank account as well as the unused portion of your line of credit established for overdrafts. 

Check the policies of your card issuer; some offer more 

generous limits on a voluntary basis. Generally, banks may cover your overdrafts under their overdraft service and impose a fee on your account, or they may offer you a separate line of credit that includes interest charges. If your bank offers an overdraft service, you must opt into this service for most ATM and debit card transactions before the bank may impose any fees. Banks must disclose this option, the amount of the overdraft coverage fee, and the customer&rsquo;s right to cancel this service.

.Before You Swipe Your Debit Card
****
Although both credit cards and debit cards are easy ways to pay for your purchases, debit cards have some different levels of consumer protection and potential for consumer fees. 

image:images/pdf5131_img_10.png[] 

Debit cards are directly connected to your bank account, so when you swipe your card, make sure you have the money in your account to pay immediately. If you don&rsquo;t have enough money in your account, your bank may &ldquo;lend&rdquo; you the money and pay the overage. However, it may charge you up to $35 for this courtesy, even if the dollar amount the bank covered was small. Determine whether you can opt out of overdraft protection. Some banks also charge you a monthly fee for making purchases with your debit card. Since new fees can be added without warning, be sure to check periodically for changes to your account fees for using your debit card. 

Debit cards don&rsquo;t offer as much protection against fraudulent use or if your card is lost or stolen. Also, if you need to dispute a purchase, you are in a weaker position because the merchant already has the money and will only return it if you win the dispute. 

Also, when you use your debit card to make reservations for hotels or rental cars, a hold is placed on your card (and your checking account), which can affect your other pending transactions. Even if the hold is removed, it may take as long as a week until the funds are available to you again.

=== Savings And Checking

When it comes to finding a safe place to put your money,  there are a lot of options. Savings accounts, checking  accounts, certificates of deposit (CD), and money market  accounts are popular choices. Each has different rules  and benefits that fit different needs. The bank must  provide you with the account terms and conditions when  you open your account. When choosing the one that is  right for you, consider: 

*Minimum deposit requirements.* Some accounts can only be set up with a minimum dollar amount.  If your account goes below the minimum, the bank may not pay  you interest on the money you deposited and you may be  charged extra fees. 

*Limits on withdrawals*. Can you take money out whenever you want? Are there any penalties for doing so? 

*Interest*. How much (if anything) is paid and when? Daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly?  To compare rates offered by local and national financial institutions, visit link:$$http://www.bankrate.com$$[www.bankrate.com]. 

*Deposit insurance*. Make sure your bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC). This agency protects the money in your checking and savings  accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and Individual  Retirement Accounts (IRAs) up to $250,000. For more  information, see page 106 or visit link:$$http://www.fdic.gov$$[www.fdic.gov]. 

*Credit unions*. A credit union is a nonprofit, cooperative financial institution owned and run  by its members. Like the FDIC does for banks, the National Credit  Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) insures a person&rsquo;s savings up  to $250,000. 

*Convenience*. How easy is it to put money in and take it out? Are there branches or ATMs close to  where you work and live? Can you bank by phone or Internet? 

If you are considering a checking account or another type  of account with check-writing privileges, add these items to your list of things to think about: 

*Number of checks*. Is there a maximum number of checks you can write per month without incurring  a charge? 

*Check fees*. Is there a monthly fee for the account or a charge for each check you write? 

*Holds on checks.*Is there a waiting period for checks to clear before you can withdraw  the money from your account? 

*Overdrafts*. If you write a check for more money than you have in your account, what happens?  You may be able to link your checking account to a savings account to protect yourself. 

*Debit card fees*. Are there fees for using your debit card? 

*Account fees.* Banks can charge fees on your checking or savings account to cover things like maintenance,  withdrawals, or minimum balance rules. However, the bank must inform you  of the fees up front as part of your account agreement and notify you  when changes occur. Practices vary from bank to bank, but each must inform  you of the fee change on your statement, in a separate letter, or in a  pamphlet. For more information, visit link:$$http://www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/findananswer/can-a-bank-really.cfm$$[www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov/findananswer/can-a-bank-really.cfm]. 

*Bounced checks*. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to have sufficient funds in your account to  cover the checks you write. If you try to cash a check, withdraw money, or use your debit card for an amount greater than the amount  of money in your account, you can face a bounced check  or overdraft fee. Your bank may pay for the item, but  charge you a fee or deny the purchase and still charge  you a fee. In addition, the business to which you wrote  the check may charge you an additional returned check  fee. Bounced checks can also blemish your credit record, so you may want to talk to your bank about overdraft protection.

[[unsolicited_checks_and_credit_offers]]

=== Unsolicited Checks and Credit Offers

If you cash an unsolicited check, you could be agreeing to pay for products or services you don&rsquo;t want or need. In addition, those &ldquo;guarantees&rdquo; for credit cards or loans, without consideration of credit history, are probably a scam. Legitimate lenders never guarantee credit. For more information on how to identify fraudulent solicitations, visit link:$$http://www.ftc.gov$$[www.ftc.gov]. 


.Phishing Scams
****
&ldquo;Phishing&rdquo; is the use of fraudulent e-mail designed to steal identities as well as vital personal information such as credit card numbers, bank account PINs, and passwords. Phishing e-mails often ask you to verify this type of information. Scammers also go &ldquo;SMishing,&rdquo; or phishing using text messages, by asking you to verify or confirm sensitive information. Legitimate companies never ask for your password or account number via e-mail. If you&rsquo;re not sure whether the e-mail is trustworthy, call the company directly and forward the email to pass:[<email>spam@uce.gov</email>]. If you believe you&rsquo;ve received a phishing e-mail, don&rsquo;t hit reply! The e-mail may even threaten to disable your account. Don&rsquo;t believe it! 


****


Legitimate offers of credit often come in the form of &ldquo;convenience checks,&rdquo; which credit card companies enclose with your monthly statement. However, convenience checks may carry higher fees, a higher interest rate, and other restrictions. If you don&rsquo;t want the checks, be sure to shred them to protect yourself from &ldquo;dumpster divers&rdquo; and identity thieves. 

Watch out for checks from someone in a foreign country claiming that you won a lottery, for an investment, or to pay for an item you sold online. This could be a scam. Even if you deposit the check, the check may not be legal. Don&rsquo;t rely on money from a check, especially foreign or unsolicited, until your bank says the check has cleared or if you know and trust the person who sent it to you. 

[[prepaid_cards]]

=== Prepaid Cards

Prepaid cards, also known as prepaid debit, stored value, or gift cards, are convenient ways to pay for your purchases. Banks and retailers issue them to offer consumers a way to make payments and conduct other financial transactions. You do not need to have a bank account or a credit history to use a prepaid card. There are plenty of situations where a prepaid card might be the most convenient choice, but be sure you understand the key terms and conditions BEFORE you buy. 

Many cards carry protections similar to credit and debit cards. To obtain these benefits, you must follow the instructions for registering and activating your card. Be sure to record your card information, including the customer service telephone number listed on the back of the card in a separate place, so you can get a replacement if yours is lost or stolen. Some prepaid card issuers may charge fees for card activation, maintenance, and cash withdrawals. 

If you have a problem with a prepaid card, first contact the customer service number. If the problem still isn&rsquo;t resolved, you may want to file a complaint with the proper authorities: 


*  For cards issued by retailers, contact the FTC (p. 107). You may also file a complaint with your local consumer protection office (p. 112). 


*  For cards issued by national banks, contact the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (p. 105). 


*  For cards issued by state banks, contact the FDIC (p. 106) or  state banking authority (p. 126). For more information, visit  link:$$http://www.nbpca.com$$[www.nbpca.com]. 


==== Government Benefits on Prepaid Cards

Many government agencies deliver financial benefits using prepaid cards. All Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are paid via electronic benefit cards. Beginning in March 2013, all Social Security benefits must be paid via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card, which comes with federal consumer protections.
