== Filing A Complaint



image::images/pdf5131_img_37.png[]

Even the savviest consumer has problems with a good or service at one time or another. It is your right to complain if you have a genuine consumer problem. It is also your responsibility. A problem can&rsquo;t be fixed if no one knows it exists. 


=== Contact The Seller

The first step in resolving a consumer problem is contacting the seller. You can solve most consumer problems by talking to a salesperson or customer service representative. Do this as soon as possible because some retailers have time limits on returns and refunds. If this doesn&rsquo;t work, ask for a supervisor or manager. If this fails, try going higher up to the national headquarters of the seller or the manufacturer of the item. Many companies have a special customer relations or consumer affairs division whose primary function is solving consumer problems. Many companies provide a toll-free number or address for this office on the product label, warranty, or other papers you received at the time of purchase. If this is not the case: 


*  Check the Corporate Consumer Directory portion of this Handbook for the contact information of several hundred corporations (p. 72). 


*  Visit the company&rsquo;s website and look for a &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; link. 


*  Dial the directory of toll-free numbers at 1-800-555-1212 to see whether the company has a toll-free number listed. 


*  Ask your local librarian to assist you. Most public libraries have reference books with contact information. 


*  As you do your search, keep in mind that the name of the manufacturer or parent company is often different from the brand name. The Thomas Register of American Manufacturers, a book available at many public libraries, lists the manufacturers of thousands of products. 


*  With each person you contact, calmly and accurately explain the problem and what action you would like to be taken. A written letter is a good strategy because you will have a record of your communication with the company. The sample letter (p. 57) will help you prepare a written complaint. 


*  Be brief and to the point. Note all important facts about your purchase, including what you bought, serial or model numbers, the name and location of the seller, and when you made the purchase. 


*  State exactly what you want done about the problem and how long you are willing to wait for a response. Be reasonable. 


*  Don&rsquo;t write an angry, sarcastic, or threatening letter. The person reading your letter probably was not responsible for your problem but could be very helpful in resolving it. 


*  Send your letter as certified mail or request delivery confirmation. 


*  Include copies of all documents regarding your problem. Keep the originals. 


*  Provide your name, address, and phone numbers. If an account is involved, be sure to include the account number. 


*  Keep a record of your efforts to contact the seller; include the name of the person with whom you spoke and what was done, if anything. 


=== Contact Third Parties

Don&rsquo;t give up if you are not satisfied with the seller&rsquo;s response to your complaint. Once you have given the seller a reasonable amount of time to respond, consider filing a complaint with one or more of these outside organizations: 

*State or local consumer protection offices*  (p. 112). These government agencies mediate complaints, conduct  investigations, and prosecute those who break consumer laws. 

*State regulatory agencies* that have jurisdiction  over the business. For example, banking (p. 126), insurance 130), securities (p. 134), and utilities (p. 138) are regulated at the state level. 


.Steps To Follow To Resolve A Complaint
****

*  Before starting, start a file or log to record all contacts and documents. 


*  Contact the seller. 


*  Contact the manufacturer. 


*  Contact industry trade associations. 


*  Contact local and state consumer protection/regulatory/licensing officers. 


*  Contact the local Better Business Bureau.

.File A Complaint Using Social Media
****
Social media offer an alternative to filing a formal consumer complaint. The customer relations staff at many major corporations monitor posts and complaints about their company&rsquo;s service. Someone may respond to your problem quickly, to avoid negative perceptions of their company&rsquo;s performance by other potential customers. While there is no guarantee that you&rsquo;ll get your problem resolved, it can be a worthwhile effort. 


****


*Local politicians.* Your local and state politicians may be able to help you get your complaint addressed. 

*State and local licensing agencies.* Doctors, lawyers, home improvement contractors, auto repair shops, debt collectors, and child care providers are required to register or be licensed. The board or agency that oversees this process may handle complaints and have the authority to take disciplinary action. Your state or local consumer protection office (p. 112) can help you identify the appropriate agency. 

*Better Business Bureaus* (p. 67). This network of nonprofit organizations supported by local businesses tries to resolve buyer complaints against sellers. Records are kept on unresolved complaints as a source of information for the seller&rsquo;s future customers. The umbrella organization for the BBBs assists with complaints concerning the truthfulness of national advertising and helps to settle disputes with automobile manufacturers through the BBB AUTO LINE program (p. 66). 

*Trade associations.* Companies selling similar products or services often belong to an industry association that will help resolve problems between its  members and consumers (p. 142).


*National consumer organizations.* Some of these organizations assist  consumers with complaints. Others may be unable to help individuals but are interested in hearing about problems that could influence their education and advocacy efforts (p. 109). 

*Media programs.* Local newspapers, radio stations, and television stations often have action lines or hotline services that try to resolve consumer complaints they receive. Call for Action, Inc. is a nonprofit network of consumer hotlines that educate and assist consumers with consumer problems.

=== Dispute Resolution Programs

Some companies and industries offer programs to address disagreements between buyers and sellers. The auto industry (p. 66) has several of these programs. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) offers a program to resolve investment-related disputes (p. 66). Some small claims courts also offer a dispute resolution program as an alternative to a trial. The American Bar Association (p. 142) also publishes a directory of state and local dispute resolution programs. 

Mediation, arbitration, and conciliation are three common types of dispute resolution. During mediation, both sides involved in the dispute meet with a neutral third party and create their own agreement jointly. In arbitration, the third party decides how to settle the problem. Conciliation is similar; however, you and the other party meet with the conciliator separately (not a group meeting). Request a copy of the rules of any program before deciding to participate. You will want to know beforehand whether the decision is binding; some programs do not require both parties to accept the decision. Also ask whether participation in the program places any restrictions on your ability to take other legal action. 

Some contracts include a clause that prohibits you from taking legal action and require you to engage in mandatory arbitration with a company in the case of a dispute. The clause may limit your ability to take a case to court. Be sure to read contracts carefully to see whether they include a mandatory arbitration clause. If you do not wish to be prohibited from taking legal action if needed, you can choose not to purchase an item from the company. If you have no other option, write on the contract that you don&rsquo;t agree with the clause and initial next to the statement. 


=== Small Claims Court

Small claims courts resolve disputes over small amounts of money. While the maximum amount that can be claimed differs from state to state, court procedures are generally simple, inexpensive, quick, and informal. Court fees are minimal, and you often get your filing fee back if you win your case. Typically, you will not need a lawyer— some states do not permit them. If you live in a state that allows lawyers, and the party you are suing brings one, don&rsquo;t be intimidated. Most judges make allowances for consumers who appear without lawyers. Even though the court is informal, the judge&rsquo;s decision must be followed. 

If you file a case and win, the losing party should give you what the court says you are owed without further action on your part. But some losers refuse to follow the court&rsquo;s decision. When this happens, you can go back to court and ask for the order to be enforced. Depending on local laws, law enforcement officials might sell a person&rsquo;s property or take money from a bank account or business cash register. If the person who owes the money receives a salary, the court might order an employer to garnish (deduct money from) each paycheck to pay you.

Check your local telephone book under the municipal, county, or state government headings for small claims court offices. Ask the clerk how to use the small claims court. Before taking your own case to court, observe a small claims court session and ask the court whether it has information that will help you prepare your presentation to the judge.

=== Legal Help And Information

If you need an attorney to advise or represent you, ask friends and family for recommendations. You can also contact the Lawyer Referral Service of your state, county, or city bar association listed in your local phone directory. Websites such as link:$$http://www.americanbar.org$$[www.americanbar.org] (American Bar Association) and link:$$http://www.nolo.com$$[www.nolo.com] can help you with answers to general legal questions. 


==== Tips for Choosing an Attorney

Many lawyers who primarily serve individuals and families are general practitioners with experience in frequently needed legal services, such as divorce and family matters, wills and probate, bankruptcy and debt problems, real estate, and criminal and/or personal injury. Some have a narrower focus. Be sure the lawyer you are considering has experience in the area for which you are seeking help. 

*Once you&rsquo;ve identified some candidates:* 


*  Call each attorney on the telephone, describe your legal issue, and find out whether he or she handles your situation. 


*  Ask if you will be charged for an initial consultation. 


*  Ask for an estimate of what the lawyer usually charges to handle your kind of case. 


*  Ask whether there are hourly charges or your attorney accepts a percentage of the settlement as a fee contingency. 

The initial consultation is an opportunity for you and the lawyer to get to know each other. After listening to the description of your case, the lawyer should be able to outline your rights and liabilities as well as alternative courses of action. The initial consultation is the lawyer&rsquo;s opportunity to explain what he or she can do for you and how much it will cost. You should not hesitate to ask about the attorney&rsquo;s experience in handling matters such as yours. Also, do not hesitate to ask about the lawyer&rsquo;s fees and the likely results. If you are considering going beyond the initial consultation and hiring the lawyer, request a written fee agreement before proceeding. 


==== What If You Can&rsquo;t Afford a Lawyer?

If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may qualify for free legal help from a Legal Aid or Legal Services Corporation (LSC) office. These offices generally offer legal assistance for such things as landlord-tenant relations, credit, utilities, family matters (for example, divorce and adoption), foreclosure, home equity fraud, Social Security, welfare, unemployment, and workers&rsquo; compensation. 

If the Legal Aid office in your area does not handle your type of case, it may refer you to other local, state, or national organizations that can provide help.

Free assistance may also be available from a law school program where students, supervised by attorneys, handle a variety of legal matters. Some of these programs are open to all; others limit their service to specific groups, such as senior citizens or low-income persons. Contact a law school in your area to find out whether such a program is available. 


=== Report Fraud And Safety Hazard

If you suspect a law has been violated, contact your local or state consumer protection agency (p. 112). This agency may take action or refer you to another state organization that has authority where you live. A local law enforcement officer may also be able to provide advice and assistance. 

Violations of federal laws should be reported to the federal agency responsible for enforcement. While federal agencies are rarely able to act on behalf of individual consumers, complaints are used to document patterns of abuse, allowing the agency to take action against a company. 

Throughout Part I of this _Handbook_, you will find references to federal agencies you can contact for more information, which is usually the same agency to contact with your complaint. You can also find the appropriate federal agency by using the Federal Agency Directory (p. 96). 

People who have no intention of delivering what is sold,  misrepresent items, sell counterfeit goods, or otherwise  try to trick you out of your money are committing fraud. 

If you suspect fraud, there are some additional steps to take: 


*  Contact the Federal Trade Commission (p. 107). Please note—the FTC does not handle individual consumer complaints. 


*  Report scams that use the mail or interstate delivery service to the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (p. 108). It is illegal to use the mail to misrepresent or steal money. 


*  Report scams that are Internet-based to the Internet Crime Complaint Center at link:$$http://www.ic3.gov$$[www.ic3.gov]. 

Reporting fraud promptly improves your chances of recovering what you have lost and helps law enforcement authorities stop scams before others are victimized. 

If you suspect you have a product that poses a safety hazard, report the problem to the appropriate federal agency: 


*  *Animal Products.* Food and Drug Administration 


*  *Automobiles.* National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration (p. 104) 


*  *Consumer Household Products.* U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (p. 96) 


*  *Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Devices.* Food and Drug Administration (p. 100) 


*  *Food.* Food and Drug Administration (p. 100), U.S. Department of Agriculture (p. 96) 


*  *Household Chemicals.* Environmental Protection Agency (p. 105) 


*  *Seafood.* Food and Drug Administration (p. 100), U.S. Department of Commerce (p. 97) 


*  *Toys, Baby, and Play Equipment.*U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (p. 96)
