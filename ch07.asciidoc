 Consumers have a wide variety of food choices available. You want food that is safe, nutritious, and won&rsquo;t break your budget, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that making healthier choices can help you feel your best and stay strong. You can also reduce the risk for many diseases, including heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. 


=== Healthy Food Choices

 To help you make healthy food choices, the federal government posts dietary guidelines at link:$$http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines$$[www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines].  Federal regulations also require many foods to identify fat content, fiber, and nutrients on their labels. For more information about food labels, visit link:$$http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/NFLPM$$[www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/NFLPM].

=== Saving Money On Groceries

 It can be a challenge to make healthy food choices and stay within your food budget. Here are some tips to help you get the most from your grocery budget: 


*  Take an inventory of the food you already have in your home. Plan your meals for the week, keeping in mind what you already have. 


*  Make a shopping list and stick to it. 


*  Compare unit prices (cost per ounce or pound) to get the best deal. 


*  Buy the generic store brand versions of foods. 


*  Take advantage of store loyalty savings programs as well as clipping coupons and online discounts. Remember that stores retain your purchase habits and use them for marketing purposes. See Protecting Your Privacy (p. 38) for more information. 


*  Only take advantage of the deal if you know you will eat the discounted item. It&rsquo;s not a deal if the food goes to waste. 


*  Shop the perimeter of the store for nutrient-dense foods. Processed and packaged foods tend to be more expensive. 


*  Visit your local farmer&rsquo;s market to find fresh produce. Arrive early to get the best selection or late to get the best deals. Fresh food spoils quickly, so don&rsquo;t buy more than you can eat or freeze. Find your local farmers market at link:$$http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets$$[search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets]. 


*  Shop for foods that are in season. When the supply is plentiful, the prices tend to be lower. 


*  Some stores offer discounts to customers for bringing  their own bags.

.SNAP: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
****
 The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) helps low-income people buy the food they need to maintain good health. To receive these benefits, you must apply and participate in an interview. If you are eligible, you will receive benefits in approximately 30 days. You may qualify if you are: 


*  Working for low wages or working part time 


*  Unemployed 


*  Receiving welfare or other public assistance payments 


*  Elderly or disabled and low-income 


*  Homeless 

 Benefits are distributed on a prepaid electronic benefit card (EBT) with a PIN. Use this card at approved food stores, like any other debit card. For more information about using a prepaid card, see page 7. For more information about SNAP and how to apply for benefits, visit link:$$http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/applicant_recipients$$[www.fns.usda.gov/snap/applicant_recipients.].

=== Organic Foods

 Buying organic food is a way to eat in a healthy manner and protect the environment. These foods are grown and processed according to USDA regulations and follow specific rules concerning pest control, raising animals, and the use of additives. Keep in mind that organic and natural foods tend to be more expensive than conventionally grown foods, and that the USDA does not claim that organic food is safer or more nutritious than other foods. 

 To make sure a product is certified organic, look for the USDA organic seal. You can also tell whether produce was grown organically by checking the price look up code (PLU); if the first number starts with a 4, then the food was grown conventionally, if it starts with a 9, it was grown organically. 

 Other common labels that help you choose certain types of food  products include: 

 _Free-Range or Cage-Free_. The flock was provided shelter in a building, room, or area with unlimited access to food, fresh water, and the outdoors during its production cycle. 

 _Natural_. As required by USDA, meat, poultry, and egg products labeled as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; must be minimally processed and contain no artificial ingredients. 

 _Grass-Fed_. Grass-fed animals receive a majority of their nutrients from grass throughout their life, while organic animals&rsquo; pasture diet may be supplemented with grain.
